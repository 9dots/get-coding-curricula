Students revisit JS in an unplugged challenge.

**Prep:** Draw your own pixelbot challenge on the board.

{% table %}

1) **Individual Work:** Tell students to solve the pixelbot challenge in JavaScript.
2) Discuss solutions. Ask students, what would happen if I only added the open parenthesis after the `right` like `right(`?

Answer: The computer would throw a syntax error and the program would not run.
,,,

1) Students write down their solutions on scratch paper.
2) Students raise their hands to provide answers.

Students learn how to input special characters on the keyboard and are given a series of images to recreate using pixelbot.

**Prep:** Distribute Lesson 7 | Worksheet 1

{% table %}

1) Instructions
  1. The goal is to recreate the images on pixelbot.io
  2. Ask students, “What are the special symbols you need to call a function?”
    Answer: parentheses
  3. Show students where the parentheses are located on the computer and remind them that you need to hold down shift to use them.
  4. How many elements (function calls) should be on each line? How do you go to the new line?
	 Answer: There should be 1 element per line.
  5. Show students where the return key is on the keyboard
  6. Show student an example of a syntax error on pixelbot.io. Point out the red ‘x’ that appears in the editor when you add the error.
3) Do the activity
  1. Students start working through the problems
  2. As they finish one problem, students explain to their tester (student sitting next to them) how the program they have written works. Then the tester makes sure that their output matches the image on the worksheet. If the coder solves the problem, the tester checks both boxes for that problem.
3) When students get stuck, we suggest using the Read, Write, and Debug protocols to support students. Ask students to imagine being on the Coder team from the group activities. They should try to play the roles of the writer and navigator. Then, ask students to imagine being a Bot to understand how the computer reads the code.
,,,

1) Students turn away from computers and face the teacher.
2) Students work through the activities on their computer and work as a tester for their partner.
Testers check the output for a given problem and listen to the coder’s explanation of the code, checking the boxes for that problem it is complete.

Students finish a JS worksheet to demonstrate learning

**Prep:** Distribute Lesson 7 | Exit Ticket Worksheet

{% table %}

1) **Individual Work:** Ask students to solve the exit ticket.
