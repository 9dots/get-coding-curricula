Introduce arguments by having kids do a very repetitive task.

{% overviewSection title='Objectives', icon='objectives' %}
{% endoverviewSection %}

1. Students will be able to explain the advantage of using arguments
2. Students will be able to call functions with an argument

#### Length: 45 minutes

1. Warm-up - Large pixel bot grid
2. Arguments Analogies - Explore arguments using golf swing and drill bit analogies.
3. Pixel bot challenge - Solve pixel bot challenges with arguments

Students solve a puzzle in a large pixelbot grid.

**Prep:**

- Draw the Pixel Bot image from Lesson 10 | Warm-up worksheet on the whiteboard
- Distribute Lesson 10 | Warm-up worksheet

{% table %}

1) **Individual work:** Ask students to write code to create the image from Lesson 10 | Warm-up worksheet.  Remind students that this exercise is using the icon language that they learned in Lesson 1.
2) Randomly call on one student at a time to provide each next line of code.
3) Discuss what made this particular picture difficult or frustrating to code?

	Possible answer: It required a lot of code because of the size of the grid.
,,,

1) Students individually fill out the Lesson 10 | Warm-up worksheet
2) If called on, students provide the next line of code.
3) Students raise their hands to provide an answer.

{% header title='Golf swing and drill bits', icon='objectives' %}

{% length '20 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

Explore golf swing and drill bit analogies that help students arrive at concept of parameters/arguments.

**Prep:** Distribute Lesson 10 | Worksheet 1

{% table %}

1) Model a golf swing for students. Show how the same golf swing is used for different clubs. Show the Lesson 10 | Worksheet 1 golf diagram on the board and walk students through it.
2) Model using a drill for students. Show how the same drill motion is used for different drill bits. Show the Lesson 10 | Worksheet 1 drill bit diagram on the board and walk students through it.
3) Point students’ attention to Lesson 10 | Worksheet 1. Ask students to find what is similar about the two situations depicted.
4) **Individual work:** Ask students to write down an answer.
5) With a partner, students discuss their findings.
6) As a whole class, discuss the similarities between the two situations.

Answer: The process is exactly the same (the golf swing never changes; the drill and the drill motion never change), but we can customize the output by changing the inputs (golf club, drill bit).
,,,

3) Students look at Lesson 10 | Worksheet 1
4) Students individually write down their answers on the worksheet.
5) Students get with a partner and discuss their answers.
6) Students raise their hands to offer answers.

{% length '5 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

Explain how to use arguments through observation.

**Prep:** None

{% table %}

1) Point students back to the problem on the whiteboard from Lesson 1 | Warm-up worksheet.
2) Tell students that the elements can use an argument. An argument is extra information to customize the output of a function. The argument goes into the space to the right of the element

	Example: → 5
3) Ask students what they think the argument will do in the case of the arrows?

  Answer: The number controls how many spaces to move in that direction.
4) Add a paint icon and color a blue circle next to it.
5) Ask students what they think the argument will do in the case of the paint icon?

  Answer: the argument controls what color the turtle will paint
6) Ask students how changing the color next to the icon relates to changing clubs in the golf swing?
  Answer: In both examples, the action is the same (swing the golf club, paint the square) but the input can be changed to customize the output.
7) Solve the warm up problem while narrating the steps out loud.

7) Students observe as the teacher demonstrates how to solve the problem using arguments.

{% length '20 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

Students use arguments to solve coding challenges.

**Prep:**

- Distribute Lesson 10 | Worksheet 2
- Draw problem 5 from Lesson 10 | Worksheet 2 on the board

{% table %}

1) **Individual work:** Students work on the first 4 problems on Lesson 10 | Worksheet 2. Remind students to use arguments to solve the problems more efficiently.
2) **Individual work:** Gather students’ attention and show them problem number 5. Tell students that this problem can be solved in many ways but when coding it is important to try and find the solution with the least lines of code. Students work on problem #5 and write down the number of steps it took them to complete the puzzle.
3) With a partner students discuss their solution for problem #5
4) As a whole class, discuss solutions and find the one with the least steps.
5) **Individual work:** Students finish the rest of the worksheet.

1) Students individually fill in the first 4 problems on their worksheet.
2) Students write down their solution for problem #5.
3) Students get a partner and discuss their answers.
4) Students raise their hands to give their answers.
