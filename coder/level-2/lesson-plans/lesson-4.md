- Students will write write programs using an icon language.
- Students will continue to develop proficiency in writing and reading code.

Create a medium difficulty pixel bot image for the students on the whiteboard. Students solve the problem individually and then check the work of a peer.

**Prep:** Create a medium difficulty pixel bot image on the whiteboard.

{% table %}

1) **Individual Work:** Ask students to get a blank piece of paper, write line numbers, and write the code that creates the pixel bot image on the board.
2) Students discuss the coding solution with a peer.

,,,

1) Students work individually on coding a solution to the challenge.
2) When they finish, students check their work with a partner after both have finished.

Show students how to solve a problem on pixel bot online. Also revisit **program** as a vocabulary word.

**Prep:** Browse to www.pixelbots.io and project onto the wall.

{% table %}

1) Now that students have practice creating code sequences on paper, they are ready to start writing programs.
2) Revisit the idea that a program is a sequence that a computer is able to understand.
3) On a projector, show students www.pixelbots.io
4) Use the problem you created in the warm-up to demonstrate how to solve the problem in the online interface. Show students a variety of features in the pixel bot interface:
- How to add code
- How to delete code
- How to run program
- How to reset after run
- How to insert code
5) Ask students, “What do you think we should do if we get stuck on a problem?”
,,,

1) Add student actions here and match numbers to teacher actions
5) __Answer:__ Step through code starting at the beginning like you do as a Bot.

Students are given a set of pixel bot images to reproduce on the computer. Partners star the ones that are completed. Remind students that the images with lots of shaded squares will be difficult, but they should remember to read code from the beginning when things go wrong.

**Prep:** Distribute the Pixel bot practice worksheet and write www.pixelbots.io up on the board.

{% table %}

1) Explain the exercise:
- The goal is to recreate each of the images from the worksheet by creating a program on the website.
- Tell students that they will act as testers for the person sitting next to them:
  - When they finish writing a program, students have their partner check to make sure the images match up. If they are a match, the tester puts a checkmark next to the image.
  - The programmer should then explain how their code works to the tester. If the tester is satisfied with the explanation, the tester checks the explain box.
  - The programmer can now continue on to the next challenge.
2) Students work on completing the challenges.
3) When students get stuck, ask them to imagine being on the Coder team from the group activities. They should try to play the roles of the writer and navigator. Then, ask students to imagine being a Bot to understand how the computer is reading the code.
4) **Discuss:** Which was the hardest coding challenge? Why? Was there more than one way to solve the problem?

,,,

1) Students are faced away from their computers toward the teacher.
2) Students get on their computers and go to www.pixelbots.io. Students work individually on recreating each of the images with code.
- When they finish a puzzle, students have their partner (student sitting next to them) check to make sure the images match up. If they are a match, the checker puts a checkmark next to the image and the programmer can continue on to the next challenge.
3) Students raise their hands to provide answers.

Students complete Exit Ticket.

**Prep:** Distribute Lesson 4 | Exit Ticket Worksheet.

{% table %}

1) **Individual Work:** Tell students they are going to work individually on coding the answer on the worksheet.
,,,

1) Students write their answers on the worksheet.
