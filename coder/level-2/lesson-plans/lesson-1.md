In this lesson, students play with the order of commands in Pixel Bot to explore a foundational concept in computer science—sequence.
 
{% overviewSection title='Objectives', icon='objectives' %}
{% endoverviewSection %}
 
- Know that computers run code in a sequence.
- Read, write, and execute code in a sequence.

#### Length: 45 minutes
 
**Whet students’ appetites for coding**. Hold a discussion about the ways computer code shapes our present and future world. Consider autonomous cars, music, online communities. Watch A Day in the Life of a Software Engineer (http://tinyurl.com/q966xd5) to give students a feel for coding. (10 minutes) 

<br>

**Guide students to see the importance of sequence in code**. Use [Lesson 1 | Warm-up Worksheet][warm-up]. Students first develop ideas about what each arrow and paint element does in Pixel Bot. Working with two programs that vary slightly in sequence, students then predict what Pixel Bot will paint. Compare the results of the two programs and reflect on sequence. (15 minutes) 
  
<br>

**Demonstrate how a computer executes a program**. Draw a Pixel Bot program and grid on the whiteboard (about 3 or 4 lines of code) and work with students to read, step through, and number the code. At the same time, trace and paint with the Bot. Repeat a few times. (10 minutes) 
 
<br>
 
**Students practice reading, writing, and executing code**. Use Worksheet 1 | [Page 1][worksheet1-1] & [Page 2][worksheet1-2]. Students read and step through code while tracing and painting with the turtle. (10 minutes)

1) Lead a discussion: 
 
```
What do you think it means to be a coder? 
```
```
Where is code used in our world?
``` 
2) Chart responses on the whiteboard.
3) Offer other applications: autonomous cars, streetlights, music, etc.
4) Watch video: A day in the life of a software engineer: [http://tinyurl.com/q966xd5](http://tinyurl.com/q966xd5)

Coders:
```
Work on computers
Hack things
Create video games
Make websites
Work with data
```
We use code in:
```
Phones
Cars
Computers
Traffic lights
Spaceships
Game consoles
Movies and tv shows
```

1) Distribute [Lesson 1 | Warm-up Worksheet][warm-up].
2) Introduce the idea of reading code with care:
```
Imagine being a computer when you read code. 
```
```
As computers, we read carefully. We pay attention to every detail. Every line of code.
```
3) Develop ideas about the coding elements in warm-up:
```
What do you think these elements do?
```
4) **Individual Work:** Have students fill out the worksheet.
5) While students code, draw the worksheet's programs and grids on the whiteboard. 
6) Reflect on sequence:
```
How did you arrive at your answer? 
```
```
What is the difference between the two programs? 
```
```
How does the order of the icons matter?
```
7) Solve the problems together on the whiteboard.
8) Work as a class to define each element.

3)
Possible Responses:
```
The bot rotates in place.
The bot jumps.
The bot moves until it hits the edge.
The bot shoots lightning.
```
Correct Responses:
```
The bot moves one square at a time.
The bot moves up, right, left, and down.
The bot paints.
```
4) Trace the movement of the Bot. Color in anything it paints.
6) 
I arrived at my answer by:
```
Reading one element at a time.
Moving the bot after each element.
Reading each line of code.
```
The two programs:
```
Have the same elements.
Have elements in a different order.
Change the order of two elements.
```
As a result:
```
The bot paints a different square.
```
7) Call out lines of code and bot actions.
8) Write definition of each element on the worksheet.

Demonstrate how to read code by reading and stepping through three or four example programs.
 
 
1. Draw a blank 3x3 grid on the whiteboard
2. Write a short (3 line) program on the whiteboard
 
 
{% table %}
 
1) Explain that when a computer executes code, it runs it in the order that it is written. This is called sequencing.
2) Point to the program on the whiteboard and ask students, “What is the first line of code?” After they answer, put a number 1 next to the corresponding line. Move the pixel bot according to the line of code just numbered.
3) Continue reading and stepping one line at a time. Trace the path of the pixel bot as it moves and shade in the squares whenever it paints.
4) Show students three new examples (design these problems on the fly, making them interesting and complex enough), reading and stepping together as a class.

2) Students raise their hands to answer questions.
4) Students follow along and offer answer for what each action does.

Students individually practice reading code.
 
**Prep:** Distribute Worksheet 1: [Page 1][worksheet1-1] & [Page 2][worksheet1-2]
 
{% table %}
 
1) **Individual Work:** Leave the worked example from the previous activity on the whiteboard. Ask students to individually fill out the worksheet. Remind students to trace the path of the pixel bot and to shade in squares whenever the pixel bot paints.

1) Students read the code, trace the pathway of the pixel bot, and paint the correct blocks on the worksheet.
