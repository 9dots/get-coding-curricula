In this lesson, students play with the order of commands in unplugged Pixel Bot exercises. The lesson explores a foundational concept in computer science—sequence.

{% overviewSection title='Objectives', icon='objectives' %}
{% endoverviewSection %}

- Know that computers run code in a sequence.
- Read, write, and execute code in a sequence.

#### Length: 45 minutes

**Demonstrate** how coders shape our world. (10 minutes)

1. Present an array of examples of where we find code in the modern world. Consider autonomous cars, music, online communities.
1. Watch "A Day in the Life of a Software Engineer" (http://tinyurl.com/q966xd5).

<br>

**Unearth** students’ ideas about computer sequencing using the [warm up worksheet][warm-up]. (15 minutes)

1. Students develop ideas about how the arrow and paint elements work in Pixel Bot.
1. Students step through and enact the two programs in the worksheet.
1. Gather students’ ideas about computer sequencing and show how a slight change in sequence alters the outcome.  

<br>

**Demonstrate** how to read a program like a computer. (10 minutes)

1. Draw a Pixel Bot program and grid on the whiteboard (3 or 4 lines of code, 3 x 3 grid).
1. Work with students to step through and enact the program. Show the usefulness of numbering lines of code.
1. Repeat a few times with new programs.

<br>

**Support** students’ practice of reading programs using worksheet 1 ([Page 1][worksheet1-1] & [Page 2][worksheet1-2]). (10 minutes)



1. Students step through and enact the programs by tracing the route of the pixel bot and shading in any squares that it paints.

- **Sequence** - The idea that statements must be performed in the order they are written.
- **Program** - A list of statements that a computer can perform.

1) Lead a discussion:


> What does it mean to be a coder?
> > Work on computers, hack on things, create video games, make websites, and work with data.

> Where is code used?
> > In phones, computers, traffic lights, spaceships, game consoles, and movies and tv shows.

2) Chart responses on the whiteboard.

3) Offer other examples:

> Code is also used in autonomous cars, streetlights, music, flight simulators and more...

1) Distribute [Lesson 1 | Warm-up Worksheet][warm-up].
2) Introduce reading code with care:

> Imagine being a computer when you read code.
> As computers, we read carefully. We pay attention to every detail. Every line of code.

3) Have students interpret the coding elements in the warm-up:

> What do you think these elements do?
> > The bot moves one square at a time.
> > The bot moves up, right, left, and down.
> > The bot paints squares.

4) Have students fill out the worksheet.

```student
Students trace the movement of the Bot and then paint with the Bot.
```

5) While students code, draw the worksheet's programs and grids on the whiteboard.
6) Reflect on sequence:

> How did you arrive at your answer?
> > By reading one element at a time and moving and painting in the order that I read.

> What is the difference between the two programs?
> > The elements are in a different order.

> How does order matter ?
> > The bot paints a different picture depending on the order.

7) Solve the two warm-up problems together on the whiteboard.

```student
Students call out lines of code and bot actions.
```

8) Work as a class to define each element.

1) Draw a blank 3x3 grid on the whiteboard.
2) Write a short (3 or 4 line) program on the whiteboard.
3) Explain sequence:

> When a computer executes code, it steps through the code in the correct order. This is called sequencing.

4) Read the first line of code together:

> What is the first line of code?
> > Call out the first line of code.

Number the first line of code.
5) Move the Pixel Bot after reading each line. Trace its path or shade in a square.

```student
Students call out where Pixel Bot should move.
```
6) Continue reading and stepping one line at a time.

```student
Students continue helping to read the code.
```
7) Read and step through three new examples with the class. Design problems on the fly, making them interesting and complex enough.

1) Distribute Worksheet 1: [Page 1][worksheet1-1] & [Page 2][worksheet1-2].
2) Leave the worked example from the previous activity on the whiteboard.
3) Ask students to individually fill out the worksheet.

```student
Students read the code, trace the pathway of the pixel bot, and paint the correct blocks on the worksheet.
