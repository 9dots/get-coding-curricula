#### Length: 45 minutes
 
1. Whet students’ appetites for coding. Hold a discussion about the ways computer code shapes our present and future world. Consider autonomous cars, music, online communities. Watch A Day in the Life of a Software Engineer (http://tinyurl.com/q966xd5) to give students a feel for coding. (10 minutes)
1. Guide students to see the importance of sequence in code. Use [Lesson 1 | Warm-up Worksheet][warm-up]. Students develop ideas about what each arrow and paint element does in Pixel Bot. Working with two programs that vary slightly in sequence, students predict what Pixel Bot will paint. Compare the results of the programs and discuss sequence. (15 minutes)
1. Demonstrate how a computer executes a program. Draw a Pixel Bot program on the whiteboard (about 3 lines of code) and work with students to read, step through, and number the code. At the same time, trace and paint with the Bot on the whiteboard. Repeat a few times. (10 minutes)
1. Students practice reading, writing, and executing code. Use Worksheet 1: [Page 1][worksheet1-1] & [Page 2][worksheet1-2]. Students read and step through code while tracing and painting with the turtle. (10 minutes)

Introduce students to the world of coding and get them excited about its endless possibilities.
 
**Prep:** Queue up video [http://tinyurl.com/q966xd5](http://tinyurl.com/q966xd5)
 
{% table %}
 
1) Lead a discussion about coding and what it means to be a coder. 

Suggested script:
 
```
Starting with this class you are now coders. 
What do you think it means to be a coder? 
Where is code used in our world?
```
 
2) Chart student responses on the board.
3) Fill in additional interesting uses for code on the board, such as autonomous cars, streetlights, music, etc.
4) Watch video: A day in the life of a software engineer.

Students individually predict the outcome of sequences and then regroup to discuss findings.
 
**Prep:** Distribute [Warm-up][warm-up]
 
{% table %}
 
1) Introduce students to the idea of reading code.
2) Ask students to develop ideas about what the coding elements mean at the top of [Lesson 1 | Warm-up Worksheet][warm-up].
 
Answer:
  - Up
  - Down
  - Right
  - Left
  - Paint
3) **Individual Work:** Tell students to read the symbols on the worksheet and paint (color in) the correct square. While students are working on the worksheet, recreate the problems on the board.
4) After they are finished, discuss the answers and how the students got to those answers. What is the difference between the two problems? Does the order of the icons matter?
5) Students write in what each symbol means on their worksheets.

2) Students raise their hands to give answers.
3) Students work individually on their worksheet.
4) Students raise their hands to give answers.
5) Students write in what each symbols means on their worksheet.

Demonstrate how to read code by reading and stepping through three or four example programs.
 
 
1. Draw a blank 3x3 grid on the whiteboard
2. Write a short (3 line) program on the whiteboard
 
 
{% table %}
 
1) Explain that when a computer executes code, it runs it in the order that it is written. This is called sequencing.
2) Point to the program on the whiteboard and ask students, “What is the first line of code?” After they answer, put a number 1 next to the corresponding line. Move the pixel bot according to the line of code just numbered.
3) Continue reading and stepping one line at a time. Trace the path of the pixel bot as it moves and shade in the squares whenever it paints.
4) Show students three new examples (design these problems on the fly, making them interesting and complex enough), reading and stepping together as a class.

2) Students raise their hands to answer questions.
4) Students follow along and offer answer for what each action does.

Students individually practice reading code.
 
**Prep:** Distribute Worksheet 1: [Page 1][worksheet1-1] & [Page 2][worksheet1-2]
 
{% table %}
 
1) **Individual Work:** Leave the worked example from the previous activity on the whiteboard. Ask students to individually fill out the worksheet. Remind students to trace the path of the pixel bot and to shade in squares whenever the pixel bot paints.

1) Students read the code, trace the pathway of the pixel bot, and paint the correct blocks on the worksheet.
