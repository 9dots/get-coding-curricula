- Know that computers run code in a sequence.
- Read, write, and execute code in a sequence.

#### Length: 45 minutes
 
  1. **Whet students’ appetites for coding.** Hold a discussion about the ways computer code shapes our present and future world. Consider autonomous cars, music, online communities. Watch A Day in the Life of a Software Engineer (http://tinyurl.com/q966xd5) to give students a feel for coding. (10 minutes)
  1. **Guide students to see the importance of sequence in code.** Use [Lesson 1 | Warm-up Worksheet][warm-up]. Students first develop ideas about what each arrow and paint element does in Pixel Bot. Working with two programs that vary slightly in sequence, students then predict what Pixel Bot will paint. Compare the results of the two programs and reflect on sequence. (15 minutes)
  1. **Demonstrate how a computer executes a program.** Draw a Pixel Bot program and grid on the whiteboard (about 3 or 4 lines of code) and work with students to read, step through, and number the code. At the same time, trace and paint with the Bot. Repeat a few times. (10 minutes)
  1. **Students practice reading, writing, and executing code.** Use Worksheet 1 | [Page 1][worksheet1-1] & [Page 2][worksheet1-2]. Students read and step through code while tracing and painting with the turtle. (10 minutes)

Introduce students to the world of coding and get them excited about its endless possibilities.
 
**Prep:** Queue up video [http://tinyurl.com/q966xd5](http://tinyurl.com/q966xd5)
 
{% table %}
 
1) Lead a discussion about coding and what it means to be a coder. 
 
```
In this class, you all will become coders. What do you think it means to be a coder? Where is code used in our world?
```
 
2) Chart student responses on the whiteboard.
3) Fill in more uses for code on the board: autonomous cars, streetlights, music, etc.
4) Watch video: A day in the life of a software engineer.

Coders:
<br>**work on computers**
<br>**hack things**
<br>**create video games**
<br>**make websites**
<br>**work with data**
<br>We use code in:
<br>**phones**
<br>**cars**
<br>**computers**
<br>**traffic lights**
<br>**buses**
<br>**game consoles**
<br>**movies and tv shows**

Students individually predict the outcome of sequences and then regroup to discuss findings.
 
**Prep:** Distribute [Warm-up][warm-up]
 
{% table %}
 
1) Introduce students to the idea of reading code with care.
```
When we read programs, we try to understand the coder's plan. What does the coder want to happen? We want to imagine being computers when we read code. We have to read carefully, paying attention to every line of code.
```
2) Develop ideas with students about what the coding elements do in [Lesson 1 | Warm-up Worksheet][warm-up].
3) **Individual Work:** Students fill out the worksheet. Ask students to trace the movement of the Bot and color in anything it paints. 
4) Recreate the problems on the board as students work.
5) After students finish, discuss sequence with students.  
```
How did you arrive at your answer? What is the difference between the two problems? How does the order of the icons matter?
```
6) Students write in what each symbol means on their worksheets.

2)
Possible Answers:
<br>The bot rotates in place
<br>The bot jumps
<br>The bot moves until it hits the edge
<br>The bot shoots lightning
<br>**The bot moves one square at a time**
<br>**The bot moves up, right, left, and down**
<br>**The bot paints**
3) Work individually on the worksheet.

Demonstrate how to read code by reading and stepping through three or four example programs.
 
 
1. Draw a blank 3x3 grid on the whiteboard
2. Write a short (3 line) program on the whiteboard
 
 
{% table %}
 
1) Explain that when a computer executes code, it runs it in the order that it is written. This is called sequencing.
2) Point to the program on the whiteboard and ask students, “What is the first line of code?” After they answer, put a number 1 next to the corresponding line. Move the pixel bot according to the line of code just numbered.
3) Continue reading and stepping one line at a time. Trace the path of the pixel bot as it moves and shade in the squares whenever it paints.
4) Show students three new examples (design these problems on the fly, making them interesting and complex enough), reading and stepping together as a class.

2) Students raise their hands to answer questions.
4) Students follow along and offer answer for what each action does.

Students individually practice reading code.
 
**Prep:** Distribute Worksheet 1: [Page 1][worksheet1-1] & [Page 2][worksheet1-2]
 
{% table %}
 
1) **Individual Work:** Leave the worked example from the previous activity on the whiteboard. Ask students to individually fill out the worksheet. Remind students to trace the path of the pixel bot and to shade in squares whenever the pixel bot paints.

1) Students read the code, trace the pathway of the pixel bot, and paint the correct blocks on the worksheet.
