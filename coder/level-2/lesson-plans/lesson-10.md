1. Students will be able to explain the advantage of using arguments
2. Students will be able to call functions with an argument

Students solve a puzzle in a large pixelbot grid.

**Prep:**

- Draw the Pixel Bot image from [Lesson 10 | Warm-up][warm-up] worksheet on the whiteboard
- Distribute [Lesson 10 | Warm-up][warm-up]

{% table %}

1) **Individual work:** Ask students to write code to create the image from Lesson 10 | Warm-up worksheet.  Remind students that this exercise is using the icon language that they learned in Lesson 1.
2) Randomly call on one student at a time to provide each next line of code.
3) Discuss what made this particular picture difficult or frustrating to code?

	Possible answer: It required a lot of code because of the size of the grid.
,,,

1) Students individually fill out the Lesson 10 | Warm-up worksheet
2) If called on, students provide the next line of code.
3) Students raise their hands to provide an answer.

{% header title='Golf swing and drill bits', icon='objectives' %}
{% endheader %}

{% length '20 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

Explore golf swing and drill bit analogies that help students arrive at concept of parameters/arguments.

**Prep:** Distribute Lesson 10 | Worksheet 1: [Page 1][worksheet1-1], [Page 2][worksheet1-2], [Page 3][worksheet1-3]

{% table %}

1) Model a golf swing for students. Show how the same golf swing is used for different clubs. Show the Lesson 10 | Worksheet 1: [Page 1][worksheet1-1] golf diagram on the board and walk students through it.
2) Model using a drill for students. Show how the same drill motion is used for different drill bits. Show the Lesson 10 | Worksheet 1: [Page 2][worksheet1-1] drill bit diagram on the board and walk students through it.
3) Point students’ attention to Lesson 10 | Worksheet 1: [Page 2][worksheet1-2]. Ask students to find what is similar about the two situations depicted.
4) **Individual work:** Ask students to write down an answer.
5) With a partner, students discuss their findings.
6) As a whole class, discuss the similarities between the two situations.

Answer: The process is exactly the same (the golf swing never changes; the drill and the drill motion never change), but we can customize the output by changing the inputs (golf club, drill bit).
,,,

3) Students look at Lesson 10 | Worksheet 1
4) Students individually write down their answers on the worksheet.
5) Students get with a partner and discuss their answers.
6) Students raise their hands to offer answers.

{% header title='Arguments', icon='objectives' %}
{% endheader %}

{% length '5 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

Explain how to use arguments through observation.

**Prep:** None

{% table %}

1) Point students to the problem on Page 3 of Lesson 10 | Worksheet 1.
2) Tell students that the elements can use an argument. An argument is extra information to customize the output of a function. The argument goes into the space to the right of the element

	Example: → 5
3) Ask students what they think the argument will do in the case of the arrows?

  Answer: The number controls how many spaces to move in that direction.
6) Ask students how adding a number next to the arrow icon relates to changing clubs in the golf swing?

  Answer: In both examples, the action is the same (swing the golf club, paint the square) but the input can be changed to customize the output.
7) Solve worksheet problem while narrating the steps out loud.

3) Students raise their hand to provide an answer.
5) Students raise their hand to provide an answer.
6) Students raise their hand to provide an answer.
7) Students observe as the teacher demonstrates how to solve the problem using arguments.

Students use arguments to solve coding challenges.

**Prep:**

- Distribute [Lesson 10 | Worksheet 2][worksheet2]

{% table %}

1) **Individual work:** Students work on the problems on Lesson 10 | Worksheet 2. Remind students to use arguments to solve the problems more efficiently.
