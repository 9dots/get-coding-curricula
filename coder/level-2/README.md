# Coder Level 2

![coder level 2](../../images/coder-level-2.jpg)

Students are introduced to core coding concepts: sequences, calling functions, passing arguments, creating loops, and using conditionals. New concepts are introduced in a steady progression from an icon-based language to a block-based language and finally to typed JavaScript. This course includes lesson plans (unplugged and online), worksheets, and a custom-designed coding environment.
