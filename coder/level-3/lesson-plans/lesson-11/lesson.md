<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students understand that computing is a creative experience and a tool for personal expression. In the next 3 lessons, students will design and create an emoji in pixelbots that they think a friend or family member will like. Today’s lesson will focus on designing how our pixel emoji will look.



<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>

- Students will use the design thinking process to prototype pixel emoji art.
- Students will use decomposition to identify components of the art.

- **Empathy:** the ability to understand and share the feelings of another
- **Ideate:** generate ideas
- **Prototype:** a first functional form of a new design
- **Plan:** a detailed outline for doing or achieving something
- **Decomposition:** breaking a problem or system into parts that are easier to understand and program

## Engage: Intro To Emojis & Pixel Art (5 mins)

- [ ] Lead a discussion about emojis and pixel art. (slide 2)
  <iconp type='question'> Why do people use emojis? </iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>They’re fun and instead of explaining how you feel in words, you can use a picture.</iconp>

- [ ] Ask the following 2 questions for each emoji slide. (slide 3-5)
  <iconp type='question'> What emotions or feelings does this emoji invoke? (slide 3, 4, 5) </iconp>
  <iconp type='question'> When would you use this emoji? </iconp>

- [ ] Introduce pixel art (slide 6)
  >>"Pixel Art is simple to create. You color squares on a grid to create art."     
  >>
  >>"Here is an example of an emoji turned into pixel art."

- [ ] Show video of [pixel art emoji](https://youtu.be/1w12ztafphk?t=32)

## Explore: Designing Pixel Emojis (35 minutes)
 >>"We are developers! And as developers we are designers, builders, artists, and coders. For the next few lessons we will focus on being designers and artists to create our very own pixel emoji. Today we will start our design process."


- [ ] Pass out Emoji Design Thinking Handout
- [ ] Introduce Design Thinking (slide 7)

- [ ] **Define** Empathize (5 minutes) (slide 8)
  - **Modeling:** Teacher thinks of a person he/she wants to create an emoji for and fills out Empathize section of handout on the whiteboard while thinking outloud.
    >>"I am creating an emoji for my dad."
    >>
    >>"My dad likes reading, math and basketball."
    >>
    >>"What I want to convey in this emoji might be my dad’s love for reading, how he always thinks about math, and the feeling of watching his favorite basketball team winning"

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students fill out Empathize section of handout. (5 minutes)

- [ ] **Define** Ideate  (5 minutes) (slide 9)
  -  **Modeling:** Teacher things out loud and the Ideate section of handout, writes ideas for emojis, then sketches some ideas listed.  
    >>“A book, a face with math symbols, excited face, basketball”

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students fill out Ideate section of handout and sketch what their emoji might look like.

- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Students share their top 2 emoji ideas and explain why they created it for the person they chose.


- [ ] **Define** Prototype (18 minutes) (slide 10)
  - **Modeling:** Show prototype of math face emoji
    - Show more of [pixel art emoji](https://youtu.be/1w12ztafphk?t=32) video from above.

- [ ] Students prototype their favorite pixel emoji idea on handout.

<note type="reminder" title="Reminder">Remind students that the designing process is iterative. If they begin prototyping and realize they want to explore a different emoji pixel design, then they should.</note>

- [ ] **Define and Explore** Decomposition (5 minutes) (slide 11)
  - **Modeling:** Circle features on math emoji prototype.
  - **Making:** Students decompose their emoji by circling features and writing what the feature is and its color.
    >> “Our decomposed emoji will be the basis of our plan to code our emoji in pixelbots.”


## Evaluate: Exit Ticket (3 minutes)
- [ ] Introduce Pixel Emojis Rubric (slide 12)
  - Focus on Design Thinking & Prototype row (slide 13)
  - Teacher models using rubric to evaluate math eyed emoji prototype
- [ ] Turn and Talk: Students share their prototype.
- [ ] Share Out: Have 2-3 students volunteer to share their prototype with the class.
