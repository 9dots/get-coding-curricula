## Engage: Review strings (10 mins)

- [ ] Remind students what they know about strings

<iconp type='question'> In coding, what is a string? </iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>A string is a group of letters or words.</iconp>

<iconp type='question'>What specials symbols are needed to use a string?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Quotation marks.</iconp>

<iconp type='question'> In coding, what is an argument? </iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>An argument is extra information that customizes the output of a function.</iconp>

## Elaborate: Pixelbots playlist (30 minutes)

- [ ] **Demonstrate pixelbots with strings:** Show students how to solve a simple pixelbots problem with the toucan animal.
	- [ ] Show students how to check the color of a square in pixelbots by hovering the mouse over it.
	- [ ] Add the code to solve the example problem.
	- [ ] Run the code to show students how the toucan paints colors.

<note type='key' title='code example'>
<codebox>{`right()\npaint('green')\nup()\npaint('lightBlue')`}</codebox>
</note>

- [ ] **Support** students in solving pixelbots challenges
	- [ ] Share the pixelbots playlist with students
	- [ ] Students work through the challenges
	- [ ] When students get stuck, we suggest using the Read, Write, and Debug protocols to support students. Ask students to imagine being on the Coder team from the group activities. They should try to play the roles of the writer and navigator. Then, ask students to imagine being a Bot to understand how the computer reads the code.

## Evaluate: Worksheet (5 minutes)

- [ ] Distribute the Lesson 10 | Wrap Up worksheet.
- [ ] Students work individually on completing this worksheet.
