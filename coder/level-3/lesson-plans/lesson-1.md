<iconp src='/icons/vocab.png'>### Vocabulary</iconp>
- **Sequence** - The idea that statements must be performed in the order they are written.
- **Function call** - A programming element that tells the computer to do something. In the beginning, most function calls will cause the computer to perform an action.

</note>

#### Engage: Welcome to coding (10 minutes)

Introduce students to the world of coding and get them excited about its endless possibilities.

- [ ] Lead a discussion about coding and what it means to be a coder.
  - Chart student responses on the board.

  >>"Starting with this class you are now coders. "

  <iconp type='question'>What do you think it means to be a coder?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Where is code used in our world?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>autonomous cars, streetlights, music, etc.</iconp>

- [ ] Watch video: [A day in the life of a software engineer][video].

<note type="tip" title="Tip">
After video, if time allows, use inspector on Chrome to show code of websites.
- View > Developer > Developer Tools
</note>


#### Explore: Predict pixel bot JS (15 minutes)

"Before we can write code, we need to learn how to read code"

- [ ] Distribute [Lesson 1 | Warm-up Worksheet][warm-up]
  - Tell students pixelbots starts on the star.
  - Students individually predict the outcome of sequences.
- [ ] **Turn and talk:** Students turn in pairs and discuss outcome of sequence.

- [ ] Discuss elements as a whole class, students define elements on worksheet.
<iconp type='question'>What do the elements at the top of the worksheet mean?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>up() - move up one square</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>down() - move down one square</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>right() - move to the right one square</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>left() - move to the left one square</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>paint() - paint the square that the pixel bot is on top of</iconp>



- [ ] Students complete worksheet individually.
- [ ] After they are finished, discuss the answers.
  <iconp type='question'>What is the difference between the two problems?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Does the order of the elements matter?</iconp>




#### Explain: Sequences (10 minutes)

>"When a computer executes code, it runs it in the order that it is written. This is called sequence. These programming elements are part of JavaScript. These particular programming elements are all function calls and that we know they are function calls because they have an open and closed parenthesis after the name."

- [ ] **Model:** how to read code by stepping and acting through two [example programs][examples].

<note>
**Prep Before Lesson**
- Draw a blank 4x4 grid on the whiteboard.
- Write the [Example Pixelbots problems][examples] on the whiteboard
- Draw star to indicate the starting square.
</note>

1. Ask "What is the first line of code?"
1. Number the corresponding line.
1. Move magnetic pixel bot.
1. Continue reading and stepping one line at a time (ask, number, move).

- [ ] **Guided Practice:** Read and step through remaining example pixelbots sequences together as a class.
  1. Ask for a volunteer
  1. Student goes to board
    1. Reads next line out loud
    1. Numbers line
    1. Moves magnetic pixel bot
  1. Repeat until challenge is complete

<note type="tip" title="Tip">
If there is time, design more problems on the fly, making them interesting and complex enough.
</note>


#### Evaluate: Read pixel bot icons (5 minutes)

- [ ] Distribute Worksheet 1: [Page 1][worksheet1-1] & [Page 2][worksheet1-2]
- [ ] Students read the code and paint the correct blocks on the worksheet.
- [ ] Review answers together as a class.
