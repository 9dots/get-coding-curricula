1. Students will be able to explain the advantage of using arguments
2. Students will be able to call functions with an argument

Students solve a puzzle in a large pixelbot grid.

**Prep:**

- Draw the Pixel Bot image from Lesson 7 | Warm-up worksheet on the whiteboard
- Distribute Lesson 7 | Warm-up worksheet

{% table %}

1) **Individual work:** Ask students to write code to create the image from Lesson 7 | Warm-up worksheet.
2) Randomly call on one student at a time to provide each next line of code.
3) Discuss what made this particular picture difficult or frustrating to code?

	Possible answer: It required a lot of code because of the size of the grid.
,,,

1) Students individually fill out the Lesson 7 | Warm-up worksheet
2) If called on, students provide the next line of code.
3) Students raise their hands to provide an answer.

{% length '20 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

Explore golf swing and drill bit analogies that help students arrive at concept of parameters/arguments.

**Prep:** Distribute Lesson 7 | Worksheet 1

{% table %}

1) Model a golf swing for students. Show how the same golf swing is used for different clubs. Show the Lesson 7 | Worksheet 1 golf diagram on the board and walk students through it.
2) Model using a drill for students. Show how the same drill motion is used for different drill bits. Show the Lesson 7 | Worksheet 1 drill bit diagram on the board and walk students through it.
3) Point studentsâ€™ attention to Lesson 7 | Worksheet 1. Ask students to find what is similar about the two situations depicted.
4) **Individual work:** Ask students to write down an answer.
5) With a partner, students discuss their findings.
6) As a whole class, discuss the similarities between the two situations.
7) Demonstrate how to use arguments in code
  - Start with the golf club example. As a class come up with a name for the function that swings the golf club: Ex. golfSwing()
  - Show students passing an argument with the first club. To pass an argument, add it between the parentheses of the function call: `golfSwing( 9 )`.
  - Ask students what the 9 represents in this case.

	Answer: The 9 represent the #9 golf club.
  - Ask students to predict the output of that function: Would the ball arc high into the air or low to the ground?

  Answer: High into the air.
  - Student write down the example on their worksheet and then fill in the function calls for the other two examples.
  - Repeat the process for the drill and drill bits.

  Answer: The process is exactly the same (the golf swing never changes; the drill and the drill motion never change), but we can customize the output by changing the inputs (golf club, drill bit).

3) Students look at Lesson 7 | Worksheet 1
4) Students individually write down their answers on the worksheet.
5) Students get with a partner and discuss their answers.
6) Students raise their hands to offer answers.
7) Students raise their hands to provide answers

Explain how to use arguments through observation.

**Prep:** None

{% table %}

1) Point students back to the problem on the whiteboard from Lesson 1 | Warm-up worksheet.
2) Tell students that the elements can use an argument. An argument is extra information to customize the output of a function. The argument goes in between the parenthesis that follow the name of the function.

Example: `up( 5 )`

3) Ask students what they think the argument will do in the case of the movements?

Answer: The number controls how many spaces to move in that direction.

4) Add `paint('blue')`
5) Ask students what they think the argument will do in the case of the paint icon?

  Answer: the argument controls what color the turtle will paint
6) Ask students how changing the color next to the icon relates to changing clubs in the golf swing?
  Answer: In both examples, the action is the same (swing the golf club, paint the square) but the input can be changed to customize the output.
7) Solve the warm up problem while narrating the steps out loud.

7) Students observe as the teacher demonstrates how to solve the problem using arguments.
