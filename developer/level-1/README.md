![developer level 1](../../images/coder-level-2.jpg)

Students begin applying core coding concepts into an Escape the Maze project. In this level, students are introduced to the Scratch block-based language and the offline maze grid. These platforms help student experience and understand new coding concepts such as sequencing, creating loops, and using conditionals.
