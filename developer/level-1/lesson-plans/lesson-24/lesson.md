## 1. Setup (8 min)

- [ ] **Finishing Touches:** Students add the final touches including instructions and notes on the project page in Scratch. 

> > “Today you get to present your projects! You probably are not done. Coders are never done with their projects because there is always something more you can do to improve on your program. Before we share our projects we need to write the Instructions and Notes.

<br/>

> > Instructions: This is where you write anything the player needs to know to play your game. You can keep the instructions that are already there or change them.

<br/>

> > Notes and Credits: This is where you can write any features you still want to add to your project.”

<br/>

> > Let’s login to Scratch and modify the instructions and notes on the project page. There are some ideas on the slides if you’re not sure what to write in Notes.”


<note type="tip">Go over the examples before having students login to Scratch.

- [ ] **Feedback:** (3 minutes) Review expectations for leaving feedback as they view each other’s games. Read the examples on the back of the feedback sheet together and have them brainstorm more ideas. These feedback sheets are for students to take home at the end of the lesson.

> > “When you are viewing each other’s games, you will also be leaving feedback on the game. This feedback should be about what you enjoyed about the game. Let’s look at some ideas for leaving feedback (read the back of the feedback sheet).”

<iconp type="question">What other hashtags might you leave after viewing a game?</iconp>

## 2. Arcade (22-32 min) 

- [ ] **Arcade** Split the class into two groups. Group A will open their Escape the Maze final project on their computer. They will stay at their computer to present their projects as Group B rotates and will leave feedback on the game. After 10 minutes the groups will switch. Show students how to circulate around the room and have students rotate to a new computer every minute. You should be circulating and monitoring the feedback students are leaving.

<note type="tip">You may need to review expectations for how to move around the room respectfully. 
Use the timer slide that is right for your class length: 10 minute groups or 15 minute groups.

- [ ] **Closing:**  Have students sign out of Scratch. Send students home with their idea journals and certificates.

> > “Your journey as a coder has just begun. Keep creating, coding, and debugging! Your idea journals are for you to keep and write your ideas for apps, games, and other projects you want to code. You can login to Scratch and Code.org from any computer anytime. Share your project with 9dots_getcoding so we can see what you’ve done.”

## 3. Final Survey (15 min) 

- [ ] **Survey:** Students take the getCoding survey to give us a sense of how they feel they have progressed as coders.

> > “As we close our final getCoding lesson of this school year we’d like you to answer a few questions about how it feels to be a coder. Take your time to answer the questions independently and honestly on your computer.”
