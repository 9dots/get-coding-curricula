<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students use their game plan to work on their final Escape the Maze project. If students get stuck they practice filling out a Bug Ticket to follow the 3 steps to debug and get assistance from their peers.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can write an if-then statement to execute a sequence if a test is true.
- When my code fails, I use the debugging protocol to debug my code.
- I can use the editor, block palette, and stage in Scratch to code my program.
- I can code a loop that makes an enemy patrol my maze.

## 1. Engage: Bug Tickets (5 min) 
Participation: Whole Class, Unplugged

- [ ] **Bug Ticket:** Students complete their own bug ticket today if they are stuck. Follow the 3 steps we practiced in Lessons 16 & 19. Introduce and read the Bug Ticket together.

> > “Today you are going to work on your projects on Scratch. As Coders we run into bugs. As coders we love the challenge of debugging our code! But sometimes we need help. Today if you need help debugging, fill out a Bug Ticket and then ask the class for help. Let’s look at a Bug Ticket together.”

## 2. Elaborate: Project Time (40 min) 
Participation: Whole Class ->  Independent, Online

- [ ] **Model** (movie) getting started on the final project using your game plans. Students should have their game plans in front of them while they are coding and use it as a reference. 

> > “You are going to have today and next week to implement your Escape the Maze game design. Follow along on your computer as we navigate to our projects.”

<note type="tip"> There are 2 movies. Play the one that your class needs to watch based on if they saved their projects in Lesson 17 or not.

- [ ] **Work time:** Students work on their final project and use a bug ticket if they are stuck on a bug in their game. Have a student fill out the bug ticket and then get the class’s attention before the student presents their bug to the class. Students can also reference the coding zine for help.

> > “You are going to have today and next week to code your final Escape the Maze game. Use your game plan. If your plan isn’t done, complete it before continuing with your project. If you need a reminder of the code we have written in previous lessons you can open the Scratch Zine using the link in the slide.”

<note type="tip">You may need to show students how to navigate to and use the zine in a new tab.

- [ ] **Closing:** Leave a few minutes at the end of class to have students check that they have saved their work to the Final Project studio before logging out. 

> > “Check that your work is saved and sign out of your Scratch account. You will have one more lesson to work on your project.”
