<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students will apply their knowledge of loops, the writing code protocol, and the Scratch editor to code the enemy movement of their choice. In this lesson we will begin to talk about user experience in the context of designing enemies that increase the level of difficulty of the Escape the Maze game without making the game so difficult that they do not want to play.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can use the editor, block palette, and stage in Scratch to code my program.
- I can code a loop that makes an enemy patrol my maze.

## 1. Kids Code (5 min)
Participation: Whole Class Unplugged

- [ ] **Engage:** Showcase young student programmer and show [video][video].

> > “Kids all around are coding and creating. You’re never too young to start! Meet Zora. She was 7 years old when she coded her own video game, Vampire Diamonds.”

<note>![slides-kidscode1](./images/slides-kidscode1.jpeg)</note>

- [ ] **Challenge** students to be the next programmer we feature.

> > “If you code a project on your own, we would like to feature your project/app at the start of our class. Code something in Scratch or Code.org or any coding platform and show it to your getCoding teacher.”

<note>![slides-kidscode2](./images/slides-kidscode2.jpeg)</note>

## 2. Explore: User Experience (5 min)
Participation: Whole Class Unplugged

- [ ] **Introduce goal** of today to finish this project benchmark:

> > “Today you will decide which enemies you want to patrol your maze. By the end of class you will submit your project. Next week we will start to learn how to make our enemies do something when you run into them.”

<note> ![slides-goal](./images/slides-goal.jpeg) </note>

- [ ] **Empathize:** Invite three students to play three versions of the Escape the Maze game on the projector: v.1 is too difficult to win, v2 is too easy, and v3 is difficult but possible to win. 

> > “When game developers are designing their game, they need to think about who they are designing it for and what they want their players’ experience to be.  If they make it too hard, the player may get frustrated with a game that can’t be beat and not want to play. If they make it too easy, the player may get bored and not want to play. Let’s look at some examples.”

<iconp type='question'>What did you think of each game?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What makes certain enemies fun to play against?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Speed, size, placement (how difficult it is to pass them)</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What makes certain enemies not fun to play against?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>When there are too many and the game is impossible to beat</iconp>

- [ ] **Define:** Process the findings from your empathy work in order to form a user point of view that you will address with your design.

<iconp type='question'>What should we keep in mind while deciding which enemies to put in your projects today?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Speed, size, placement (how difficult it is to pass them), When there are too many and the game is impossible to beat.</iconp>

## 3) Explain: Set the Challenge (5 min)
Participation: Whole Class Unplugged

- [ ] **Ideate:** Show the different enemies we have designed in various lessons. Students can either use the code for an enemy from Lessons 7, 8 & 10 or design their own. 

> > “Turn to the next blank page in your idea journal. Label it “Enemies”. How many enemies are you going to have in your game? What will each enemy do? List them on this page of your journal. You can use one of these enemies from our previous lessons, or write the code for your own.” 

<br/>

<note>![slides-ideate1](./images/slides-ideate1.jpeg)
![slides-ideate2](./images/slides-ideate2.jpeg)
</note>

- [ ] **Set the Challenge:** Show them the rubric for the finished product (see #5).

> > “By the end of class today you will submit your project with your completed enemies. Here is what I will be looking for when I review your projects:
- Program has at least four enemies on patrol.
- Enemy code uses loops.
- There aren’t extra code blocks.
- Program initiates when green flag is clicked.
- Enemies improve the user experience by making the game more challenging but not impossible.”

<note>![slides-checklist](./images/slides-checklist.jpeg)</note>

## 4) Elaborate: Prototype (20 min)
Participation: Independent, Online

- [ ] **Prototype:** Students work out of Lesson 12 studio to create their projects. Remind students to use their list of enemies. You will need to show students to use the “show” block to show the enemies they will use. Demonstrate that this can be done by double clicking the block.

<note type="tip">Students  can reset their enemies’ positions with the “r” key. Tell them don't delete the code that does this. Younger students may need you to step through the process of getting to the project and even model designing your game from your own list of enemies you ideate.

## 5) Evaluate: Submit Your Code (10 min)
Participation: Independent, Online

- [ ] **Exit Ticket:** Model how to properly title, remix/share, and add their projects to the studio for you to view. 

**Step 1:** Click “Remix”

**Step 2:** Click the title and delete remix

**Step 3:** Add your first name to title.  Example: Lesson 12 Maayan

**Step 4:** Click “See project page” 

**Step 5:** Click “Studios”

**Step 6:** Click check mark next to “Lesson 12”

<br/>
- [ ] **Evaluate:** Review with students what you are looking for when viewing their code.

> > “Before we wrap up, let’s take a few minutes to look over our work. 
- Program has at least four enemies patrolling the maze.
- Enemy code uses loops to represent repetitive actions.
- There aren’t extra code blocks that haven’t been used
- Program initiates when green flag is clicked
- Enemy movement and placement is strategic, improving the user experience by making the game more challenging but not impossible.”

<note>**Teacher’s Note:** After the lesson the teacher should view student progress in the studio and target individuals who need assistance in further programming. It is ok if students did not code all 6 enemies, but they should have the code for at least one enemy they wrote on their own.</note>
