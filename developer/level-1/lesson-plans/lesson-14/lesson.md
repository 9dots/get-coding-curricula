<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students are introduced to conditionals (if then), practice reading conditional statements in Scratch, and identify how boolean statements are related to conditionals.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can identify Boolean as true/false statements.
- I can read an if-then statement to execute a sequence if a test is true.

- **Boolean:** A statement that can be "true" or "false".
- **Conditional** Asks a boolean statement, and runs a chunk of code if the answer is true.

## 1. Kids Code (5 min)
Participation: Whole Class Unplugged

- [ ] **Showcase** a young student programmer by sharing a project from a fellow coder. Play the game and show the code behind it.

> > “Kids all around are coding and creating.”

- [ ] **Challenge** students to be the next programmer we feature.

> > “If you code a project on your own, we would like to feature your project/app at the start of our class. Code something in Scratch or Code.org or any coding platform and show it to your getCoding teacher.”

- [ ] **Motivate** students by connecting today’s lesson to their Escape the Maze game. 

> > “In Lesson 12, what happened when the hero touched an enemy? The hero was sent back to the start! This is caused by conditional statements. Today we will be learning about conditionals, the foundation to programming enemies that react when the hero touches them.”

## 2. Explore: If Then (5 min)
Participation: Small Group Unplugged

- [ ] **Classification:** Present a list of If-Then statements to act on. Students hold up True/False  cards, then respond with the appropriate action. Ask them to identify what all of these statements have in common.
 
- “If you are wearing a sweatshirt, then stand up.”
- “If you like ice cream, then put your hands on your head.”
- “If you have a dog, then stand on one foot.”
- “If you are the youngest in your family, then touch your toes.”
- “If 4 + 5 = 8, then flap your arms like a bird.”
- “If Los Angeles is in California, then take a seat.”

<iconp type="question"> These are called conditional statements. What do conditionals all have in common? </iconp>
<iconp type="answer">They all start with “If __________, then ___________. </iconp>


- [ ] **Connecting Prior Knowledge:** 

<iconp type="question"> Last week we talked about Boolean statements. Which part is the Boolean statement? </iconp>
<iconp type="answer">The If part before the then is a boolean statement. This is the part that they used True/False cards to respond to.</iconp>

- “you are wearing a sweatshirt”
- “you like ice cream”
- “you have a dog”
- “you are the youngest in your family”
- “4 + 5 = 8”
- “Los Angeles is in California”

## 3. Explain: Define (2 min)
Participation: Small Group Unplugged

- [ ] **Define** conditionals - students write it in their idea journals
> > “On a blank page in your idea journal let’s write the definition of conditional. Conditional - Asks a true/false (boolean) statement, and runs a chunk of code if the answer is true.”


- [ ] **Check for understanding** - 

<iconp type="question"> Which of these blocks are examples of conditionals? </iconp>
![check-for-understanding](./images/cfu.png)
<iconp type="answer">The if-then block</iconp>

**Possible Misconceptions:**
- Students may think a loop is a conditional because of the shape, however a conditional does not repeat on its own.
- Students may think a boolean is a conditional, but a boolean is just a part of a conditional.

## 4. Elaborate: Conditionals in Scratch (10 min)
Participation: Small Group Unplugged

- [ ] **Translation** - In pairs students rewrite the Scratch conditionals on the handout in an if-then statement. Do one example together. It’s ok if students don’t complete all of them. 

<note type="tip">Younger grades that are not as proficient in writing can do this as a Pair-Share activity where they say their statement to their partner and then share out to the class.</note>

> > “With your table partner, translate the conditional statements the Scratch code to English. Let’s do the first one together.”


- [ ] **Popcorn** - Pop around the room asking students to read their translation of each conditional and then identify the boolean statement.

**Extension Questions for Advanced Groups:** 
<iconp type="question">Which of these conditionals would change you to the next level if you touch the goal? </iconp>
<iconp type="question">Which of these conditionals sends you back to the start if you touch an enemy?</iconp>

## 5. Exit Challenge (3 min)
Participation: Small Group, Independent, Unplugged

- [ ] **Exit Challenge:** Students answer the [Exit Challenge][exit-challenge] on paper using pencil independently and turn it in.

> > “Try these three challenges independently to test your new knowledge of conditionals!”
