<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students complete a series of challenges to review the coding skills they’ve built since the start of the course. 

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can code a sequence of actions in the order I want them performed.
- When my code fails, I use the debugging protocol to debug my code.
- I can step through and act out code that contains a loop.
- I can predict the effects of code that contains a loop.
- I can recognize and identify a repeating pattern.
- I can replace a repeating sequence with a loop.
- I can identify Boolean as true/false statements.
- I can read an if-then statement to execute a sequence if a test is true.

## Room Design
You will need a 5x5 grid of foam tiles setup so that it is viewable by all students.

<iconp src='/icons/vocab.png'>### Vocabulary</iconp>
- **Loop** - A sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
- **Boolean** - A value that can either be "true" or "false".
- **Conditional** - Asks a true/false (boolean) statement, and runs a chunk of code if the answer is true.
- **Debug** - Finding and fixing errors in code.

## 1. Engage: I Have a Challenge for You (2 min) 
Participation: Whole class, unplugged

- [ ] **Call and Response:** teach students the call and response. Teacher says: “I have a challenge for you.” Students say: “Bring it, bring it.”

> > “Before we get started I’m going to teach you a call and response. Whenever you hear me say ‘I have a challenge for you’, you will respond ‘Bring it, bring it’. Let’s try it. ‘I have a challenge for you’ … (students respond ‘Bring it, bring it.’)”

<note>**Slide:** ![slides-engage](./images/slides-engage.jpeg)</note>

- [ ] **Motivate:** introduce our challenges for today.

> > “You have learned so much as coders since September! Today, working in partners, you get a chance to apply all of your coding skills to tackle a series of challenges."

## 2. Elaborate: Socrative (20 min) 
Participation: Partners, online

- [ ] **Challenge:** Students login to Socrative to complete a series of challenges similar to the ones they will complete independently on the ICC next week. It is important that students understand this is not a test and there is no final score. They should instead focus on activating all of their new coding super powers to tackle the challenges. Run this “Teacher Paced” so that you can display and discuss the classes’ answers after each question. Allow students to work in pairs on this challenge and encourage academic discourse: 
	- “I disagree because…”
	- “Show me how you got…”
	- “What line of code…”

<note type="tip">Budget 1 minute per question. There is a timer gif in the slides: ![slides-socrative1](./images/slides-socrative1.jpeg) ![slides-socrative2](./images/slides-socrative2.jpeg)</note>

## 3. Elaborate: Rover (23 min) 
Participation: Partners, unplugged

- [ ] **Challenge:** Students move Rover around their grids to practice reading and debugging code with loops and conditionals. Give students time to work in partners and then share whole group. Use the foam tiles to have students act out code. Encourage academic discourse: 
	- “I disagree because…”
	- “Show me how you got…”
	- “What line of code…”
