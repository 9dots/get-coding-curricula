- I can code a sequence of actions in the order I want them performed.
- I can use the editor, block palette, and stage in Scratch to code my program.

{% length '15 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

Students code along with the teacher for 15 minutes. Stop the activity at 15 minutes to ensure time for inidividual coding with the Dance Off activity. 

**Prep:**
- Computers
- Plan Chart
- "If You Give a Mouse a Cookie" book or audiobook
Use [this](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/121824209/) Scratch Project for student code along. 

{% table %}

1) Read “If You Give a Mouse a Cookie” to students (3 min)

2) Show the step by step plan (2 min)
  *Ask students to identify connection between a step and what happened in the story.

Mouse Will:
1. Ask for a glass of milk
2. Go to Milk
3. Ask for a straw
4. Go to straw
5. Ask for a napkin
6. Go to napkin
7. Look in the mirror
8. Go to mirror
9. Ask for a pair of scissors
10. Go to scissors

**Code Along (10 min)**

* Setup 
  * Navigate to “My Classes”, “Exploring Scratch” studio, and open project “If You Give a Mouse a Cookie”
  * Click the green flag to show that the project doesn’t do anything yet… we need to code it!
  * Click “See Inside”
  * Click “Remix”
  * Re-title your work

* Coding
  * The events block indicates when the sequence should begin: 
  ![Scratch Block](lesson-4/img/When Clicked.png "Scratch Block")

  * Code the first 2 steps of the plan:
  ![Scratch Block](lesson-4/img/if you give a mouse 1.png "Scratch Block")

  * Pause to run the program and check it is making sense
  * What do you think the next two blocks will be?
  ![Scratch Block](lesson-4/img/if you give a mouse 2.png "Scratch Block")

  * Continue to code and pause to check after every 1-2 lines you add. Check off the plan as you go through it. Every time you re-run it you will need to move the mouse back to its starting point.

3) Check student work. 

,,,

1) Students sit facing teacher, computers closed.

2) Students identify that:
  * Steps 1 & 2 are “... it’s going to want a glass of milk.”
  * Steps 2 & 3 are “... it’s going to ask for a straw.”
  * Steps 3 & 4 are "...it's going to ask for a napkin."
  * Steps 5 & 6 are "...it's going to ask for a straw." 
  Continue until you feel students understand the sequence.

3) Students turn to their computers and follow the steps in the code along, giving thumbs up when ready for a next step.

* Remind students to:
  * Code the correct sprite
  * Choose the “say for 2 sec” block
  * Move the mouse back to its starting point before re-running the code

{% length '25 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

Students code along witht the teacher until they are ready to plan, code, and validate their dance off code. 

**Prep:**
- Idea Journals
- Computers
- Pencils

{% table %}

1) **Plan 3 step dance (5 min)**

* Introduce activity: “We are going to choreograph a dance for our Sprite.”
* Pick 5 dance moves for our sprite to execute (prioritize using the highlighted blocks): 
  * Say
  * Move
  * Turn
  * Think
  * Change size
  * Change color
  * Next costume
* Write out the 5 dance moves in order on your planning chart

2) Code Along (10 min)
* Setup 
  * Navigate to “My Classes”, “Exploring Scratch” studio, and open project “Dance Off”
  * Click the green flag to show that the project doesn’t do anything yet… we need to code it!
  * Click “See Inside”
  * Click “Remix”
  * Re-title your work

**Code**

* We will begin when the green flagged is clicked: 
![Scratch Block](lesson-4/img/When Clicked.png "Scratch Block")

* Drag coding blocks to represent the 3 actions and test code by pressing the green flag

**Adjust**

* Play with what happens when you change numbers in each block. After each adjustment run the code gain to see how it affected the dance.

**Repeat**
* Copy and paste the blocks using the stamp tool so that it repeats the actions multiple times.

3) Students plan and code dances for Khalid (10 min)
* (2 min) In idea journals have students write out their 5 step dances using the given blocks
* (8 min) Students delete the code we have and create their own 

4) Share dances (5 min)
* Click “Share”
* Click “Studios” under your project
* Click the check mark next to “Dance Off”

5) Go over norms for viewing peer’s work
* Constructive Feedback: “It would be cool if…”
* Positive Speak: Tell someone what you like about their program before giving any constructive feedback
* No negative comments

6) Students view their peer’s work
* Click “Dance Off” to view everyone’s dances

,,,

1) Students volunteer 5 dance moves from the list to choreograph their dance.

2) Students follow along on their computers as they code the dance for the first sprite.

3) Students plan in their idea journals their dance.

4) Students put their projects into the shared studio

5) Students read norms and share additional norms they would like their peers to adhere to.

6) Students browse each other’s projects in the studio.
