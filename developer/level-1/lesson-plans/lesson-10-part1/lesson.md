<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
We want to establish a coding learning culture where students enjoy challenging themselves, enjoy learning new things, and like to address weaknesses in their understanding. Students review their Independent Coding Challenges from Lesson 9 and acknowledge their progress as coders while addressing bugs in their code. 

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can use the editor, block palette, and stage in Scratch to code my program 
- I can code a sequence of actions in the order I want them performed.
- I can use the debugging process to debug my code. 
- I can step through and act out code that contains a loop.
- I can predict the effects of code that contains a loop.
- I can recognize and identify a repeating pattern.
- I can replace a repeating sequence with a forever loop, for-loop, or while loop to increase code efficiency and readability.

## 1. Independent Coding Challenges (10 min)
Participation: Whole Class, Unplugged

- [ ] **Motivate**

> > “In lesson 9 you complete an Independent Coding Challenge because you are coders and coders love to challenge themselves. We want you to see how much you have learned so today we’re going to look at how we did on our challenges. Just a few months ago you had probably never coded before!” 
<br/>

<note type='key' title='Key Point:'>As coders we enjoy challenging ourselves, enjoy learning new things, and like to address weaknesses in our understanding.</note>

- [ ] **Deliberate Practice:** Hand back students’ Independent Coding Challenges for students to follow along.

> > “I’m going to hand back your Independent Coding Challenges. When you get yours, celebrate the challenges you completed without any bugs. Together we can talk about any challenges you struggled with and try to debug your code. Celebrate how much you are learning just from debugging!”

<br/>
- [ ] **Exemplaries:** Select a few examples of ICC answers that are neatly and accurately completed to shout out to the class.  Do not include names.

> > “We saw a lot of great examples of code. Let’s look at some of these together.”

<iconp type='question'>What makes this great code?</iconp>

- [ ] **Productive Failure:** Select a few incorrect answers that represent common errors. Do not include names.

> > “When I give you a challenge I expect that not everyone will get everything correct. When you struggle it means you’re learning. Part of growing as a coder is identifying and correcting bugs. These are some examples of bugs that a lot of us made. Let’s see if we can correct them together.”

<iconp type='question'>Where do you see a bug?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What error did this coder make when reading this code?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What could this coder have done to avoid making this error?</iconp>
