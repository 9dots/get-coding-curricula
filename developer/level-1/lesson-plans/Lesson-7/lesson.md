<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students practice reading code by predicting and stepping through the code of enemies 1-3 in the maze game. Enemies have repeating behavior so students will have to be comfortable reading code that has loops.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can step through and act out code that contains a loop.
- I can predict the effects of code that contains a loop.
- I can summarize what a section of code does on the stage.

- **Loop:** A sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
- **For-Loop:** A type of loop that specifies the number of times to repeat the nested sequence of instructions.

## Engage: Super Mario (5 min)
- [ ] **Unearth loops in examples of video games:** Students turn to the next blank page in their idea journal and title it Loops. Play the Super Mario Bros. video and have students create a list of examples of actions that may be coded as a loop in the video game.

<note type='key' title='Key Points'> 
Loops allow us to repeat sequences without having to write out the entire sequence multiple times.
</note>

- [ ] [Think Pair Share:][tps] Students share their list of loops.

## Elaborate: Support Stepping Through Loops: (10 min)

- [ ] Show students the code for Enemy 1.
<iconp type='question'>What do you predict this code will do?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Answers will vary</iconp>

<note type='tip'>
The "Wait 1 secs" block is necessary in Scratch to be able to see the Sprite's movement. When acting out the code, students can pause for one second every time they see this block.
</note>

- [ ] Step through the code using the strategy from lesson 6:
	- Demonstrate uncovering each line one at a time using a sheet of paper (students use an index card). 
	- Make a  mark at the end of the sequence each time you complete a loop.

- [ ] For grades proficient in writing: Students write a sentence summary in their idea journals of each enemyâ€™s movements.

- [ ] Repeat this process for Enemies 2 & 3.

## Evaluate: Salsa Practice (5 min)

- [ ] In pairs students predict and step through the code from one of the four cards. 
<note type='tip'>
The chili peppers represent the level of difficulty of a card. Four peppers is the most challenging.
</note>

- [ ] Observe student work to evaluate how comfortable students are reading loops. 

- [ ] Encourage pairs that finish early to try a more challenging card.
