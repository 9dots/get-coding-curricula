<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students practice reading code by predicting, stepping through, and summarizing the code of enemies 1-3 in the maze game. Enemies have repeating behavior so students will have to be comfortable reading code that has loops.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can step through and act out code that contains a loop.
- I can predict the effects of code that contains a loop.
- I can summarize what a section of code does on the stage.

- **Loop:** A sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.

</note>


## 1. Engage: Enemies (5 min)

- [ ] **Write Pair Share:** Students write a list of loops they see in the GIF of our Escape the Maze. They then share their lists with their partners before sharing out to the class.

<iconp type="question">In your workbook, describe the movement that is looping for each of the enemies in this GIF of our Escape the Maze game.</iconp>
<iconp type="answer">Red - spinning forever</iconp>
<iconp type="answer">Green - grows & shrinks forever</iconp>
<iconp type="answer">Yellow - moves left, moves right, forever</iconp>
<iconp type="answer">Orange - moves in a square forever</iconp>
<iconp type="answer">Blue - moves up, moves down, forever</iconp>
<iconp type="answer">Black - moves left, spins, moves right, spins forever</iconp>

## 2. Explore: Predict (5 min)

- [ ] **Predict:** Students predict what code with a loop will do before stepping through it.

<iconp type="question">Here is the code for one of the enemies we just saw. What do you predict this code will do? What movement do you think the enemy will do when it runs this code?</iconp>
<iconp type="answer">Answers will vary</iconp>

## 3. Explain: Step & Summarize (10 min)

- [ ] **Step:** Have a student step through the code using the strategy from lesson 6, uncovering each line with an index card and making a tally mark at the end of the sequence while a Bot acts as the enemy on the foam tiles.

> > "I need one student to be the Coder and read the sequence one line at a time. Don’t forget to use an index card and tally marks. A second student will be the Bot and act it out on the foam tiles."

<br/>
- [ ] **Summary:** Students summarize verbally or in their journals how the code performed.

<iconp type="question">What did the code do? What movement did the enemy do when we ran this code?</iconp>
<iconp type="answer">Enemy moves forwards and backwards 3 times, waiting for 1 second between each movement.</iconp>

- [ ] **Coders & Bots:** Students try the next two code examples on their paper, using their enemy character to act out the code. Then check both examples as a class.

> > “Now it’s your turn! Acting as Coders & Bots, predict and step through the enemy code in the next two examples. We will check our work together after.”

<iconp type="question">Raise your hand if you are the Coder. What is your job as Coder?</iconp>
<iconp type="answer">Check that each pair has one Coder. They will be reading the code, using the index card, and making tallies.</iconp>
<iconp type="question">Raise your hand if you are the Bot. What is your job as Bot?</iconp>
<iconp type="answer">Check that each pair has one Bot. They will be moving the enemy and validating the code.</iconp>

## 4. Elaborate/Evaluate: Salsa Practice (10 min)

- [ ] **Coders & Bots:** Students work in pairs to predict, step, and summarize the code of an enemy from one of the four options: mild, medium, spicy, and wow that’s hotttt. Then check all examples as a class. Observe student work to evaluate how comfortable students are working with loops. Encourage pairs that finish early to try a more challenging card.

> > “Let’s make it more challenging. Acting as Coders & Bots, choose one of the four salsa cards to predict, step through, and summarize how the enemy moves in the code. The number of chilli peppers shows you how challenging the code is.”

<iconp type="question">Raise your hand if you are the Coder. What is your job as Coder?</iconp>
<iconp type="answer">Check that each pair has one Coder. They will be reading the code, using the index card, and making tallies.</iconp>
<iconp type="question">Raise your hand if you are the Bot. What is your job as Bot?</iconp>
<iconp type="answer">Check that each pair has one Bot. They will be moving the enemy and validating the code.</iconp>

## 5. Extension: Independent Coding (20-35 min)

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students move at their own pace through the Code.org studios. Play the video to review using Code.org if students need a reminder. If you’d like to give students a more targeted lesson about loops you can direct them to complete Course 2 Stage 8: Bee Loops.
