<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
We want to establish a coding learning culture where students identify as coders. They enjoy challenging themselves, learning new things, and addressing weaknesses in their understanding. Students complete an Independent Coding Challenge to see their progress in the learning objectives from lessons 1-20.

## 1. Engage: I Have a Challenge for You (2 min) 
Participation: Whole class, unplugged

- [ ] **Motivate:** introduce our challenges for today.

> > “You are coders! Coders love to challenge themselves. So today we are going to do a series of Coding Challenges. We want you to see how much you have learned about coding. Some of the challenges may feel easy. Some of the challenges may feel really challenging, which is good! So coders, I have a challenge for you (pause for students to respond “bring it bring it”).”

<br/>

- [ ] **Bugs:** introduce the bug erasers.

> > “For your final challenge today, instead of using a bean like we did last week, I have these bug erasers for you. Use them to complete your challenge and then they are yours to keep and remind yourself of all the challenging bugs you will take on as coders."

## 2. Evaluate: Challenges (43 min) 
Participation: Independent, unplugged

- [ ] **Bonus**: Tell students #10 is a bonus and should be done last.

> > "Let's look at the challenges. Number 10 is a bonus question so complete the first 9 challenges first before starting on number 10.”

<note> **Slides:** ![slides-bonus](./images/slides-icc1.jpeg)</note>

- [ ] **Expectations:** Set the expectations for a positive classroom environment for students to feel they can concentrate and push themselves. 

> > - (If necessary for room setup:) Use the privacy shields to help you concentrate.
> > - We want to see your own code, so work independently.
> > - Coding takes a lot of brainpower, so keep the room silent for your fellow coders to concentrate.
> > - If you have a question or don’t understand a challenge, ask your teacher with a silent hand.

<note> ![slides-expectations](./images/slides-icc2.jpeg)</note>

- [ ] **Independent Coding Challenge:** Students work independently on the challenges. When students are finished encourage them to review and validate their answers. They can then work on their Final Projects or go to Code.org. If a student is stuck you can help them by:
    - Read the question out loud.
    - Ask guiding questions without giving away an answer:
	    - Do you remember when we painted with Rover?
	    - Did you validate your code to make sure there are no bugs?
	    - Did you use the index card to read each line of code one at a time?
	    - What does “sequence” mean?
	    - What is a “loop”?

> > "Let's get to the challenges. Use your index cards and enjoy!"
