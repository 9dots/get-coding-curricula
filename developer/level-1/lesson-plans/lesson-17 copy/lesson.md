<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students apply their knowledge of conditionals to write code in their Escape the Maze projects that cause the hero and enemies to interact.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can write an if-then statement to execute a sequence if a test is true.
- I can write a conditional (if-then) to make my maze hero and enemies interact.

## 1. Engage: Kids Code (5 min)
Participation: Whole class, Online

- [ ] **Showcase:** Choose a student from your class to show off their current Escape the Maze project or a personal project. 

## 2. Explore: Design (5 min)
Participation: Independent, Unplugged

- [ ] **Plan:** Students plan the conditionals they will add to their game.

> > “Game designers do not just start coding without first creating a design or plan for their game. Let’s take a few minutes to return to our Escape the Maze game plans. On the Game Plan there is space for us to plan how each Sprite is going to interact with others through conditionals. We are going to fill out the right column with the “If________, then_______” statements. Last lesson we practiced writing some of these conditionals in Scratch. Here are some ideas of code we’ve already written: 
> > - Hero: If touching an enemy, then go back to the start.
> > - Hero: If touching the goal, then change backdrop to level 2 and go back to the start.
> > - Enemy: If touching the hero, then the enemy changes color.
> > - Enemy: If touching the hero, then the enemy grows.
> > - Enemy: If touching the hero, then the enemy chases the hero.
> > - Take a minute to write your plan for each sprite before we start to code.”

## 3. Explain: Code Along (5 min) 
Participation: Whole class, Unplugged

- [ ] **Code Along:** Play the code along video to show students how to navigate to their project and code the conditionals from their game plan.

## 4. Elaborate: Code (25 min)

- [ ] **Make:** Students add the conditionals code to their projects following their plan and the code we demoed in the Code Along.

> > “Now that you have seen the power of conditionals, it is your turn to write conditionals into your Escape the Maze project. Don’t forget to use your game plan.”

## 5. Evaluate: Submit (5 min)

- [ ] **Evaluate:** Students check their projects against the rubric checklist and ensure their project is in the Lesson studio.

> > “Let’s read through the project checklist on the back of your game plan to see how we are doing with our projects. You will have more time to work on the project so you are not expected to be done today. Check off each item if you have completed it.”
