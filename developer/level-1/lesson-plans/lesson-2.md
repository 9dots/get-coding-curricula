<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students get comfortable using the Scratch editor and writing a sequence in code by translating If You Give a Mouse a Cookie to a Scratch game.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can code a sequence of actions in the order I want them performed.
- I can use the editor, block palette, and stage in Scratch to code my program.

## 1. Engage: If You Give a Mouse a Cookie (5 min)
Participation: Whole Class, Unplugged

- [ ] **Hook:** Read If You Give a Mouse a Cookie outloud to the class.

<note>**Slides:** ![slides-hook](./lesson-2/images/slides-hook.jpeg)</note>

- [ ] **Plan:** Explain that we are going to practice coding a sequence by coding the sequence of the book. Show the step by step plan.

<iconp type="question">Ask students to identify connection between a step and what happened in the story.</iconp>

## 2. Explore/Explain: Code Along (20 min)
Participation: Whole Class, Online

- [ ] **Introduce Scratch:** Introduce students to the coding program we will be using this year - Scratch. Show the ‚ÄúGetting Started with Scratch Video‚Äù.

> > ‚ÄúThere are lots of different coding languages: Javascript, Python, C++, HTMl, CSS, Java, M. This year we will be using a language called Scratch. Today you are going to code If You Give a Mouse a Cookie in Scratch.‚Äù

<note>![slides-scratch](./lesson-2/images/slides-scratch.jpeg)</note>

- [ ] **Code Along:** Point students to their log-in stickers. This is a good time to have them put their sticker somewhere that they will not loose it, like on their journals. Play the code along video. Pause the video to allow students to answer the questions posed.

üé• Code Along Video:
- Navigate to Scratch
- Logging In
- Navigate to the project
- Dragging blocks to the script area: When green flag clicked, move 10 steps
- Connecting blocks
- Click the green flag to run the code
- Change the number in the block
- Add another block
- Separating blocks
- Delete blocks
- Use the ? to find out what a block does

## 3. Elaborate: Independent Coding (20 min)
Participation: Independent, Online

- [ ] **Challenge** students to continue coding on their own to follow the sequence of the story. Encourage students to explore other blocks that improve the story if they‚Äôve completed the planned sequence.
![plan](./lesson-2/images/plan.jpeg)

	Anticipating Student Misconceptions:
	- Coding in the wrong sprite - Students should be coding in the sprite where the action is occuring. 
	- Taking a ‚Äúsay‚Äù block instead of ‚Äúsay for 2 sec‚Äù - without the time, Scratch will perform the action so quickly that it won‚Äôt be seen on the stage.
	- Deleting the starter code - Students should not change or delete the first two blocks as they ensure that whenever the green flag is pressed the mouse returns to its original position. 

<note>![slides-code](./lesson-2/images/slides-code.jpeg)</note>

- [ ] **Closing:** Congratulate coders on their first program!

## 4. Extension: Further Exploration in Scratch (5-60 min)
Participation: Independent, Online

- [ ] **Extension:** If you want to give your students more practice in Scratch, use the Introductory Tutorials. Play each tutorial video at least twice. The first time have them just watch, the second time have them follow along. Start with ‚ÄúMake your sprite move forward‚Äù and go from there depending on how much time you have.
