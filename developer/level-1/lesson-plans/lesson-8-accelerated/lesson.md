<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In this lesson students identify repeating patterns in a sequence and replace the repetition with more efficient code by using a loop.  This is students’ first lesson in writing code with loops. Younger students may need more support and practice with pattern recognition.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can recognize and identify a repeating pattern.
- I can replace a repeating sequence with a forever loop, for-loop, or while loop to increase code efficiency and readability.
- I can code a loop that makes an enemy patrol my maze.

## 1. Explore: Patterns in Cubes (10 min)

- [ ] Handout containers of unifix cubes so each student has enough to build their own pattern.

> > "Today we are going to practice finding patterns because loops are really just patterns."

- [ ] Students build the pattern shown on the board.

> > "Build this pattern using the cubes at your table."

![pattern1](./images/unifix-cubes-pattern1.jpeg)

- [ ] Identify the repeating section of code and break that section off.

<iconp type='question'>What is repeating in this pattern?</iconp>
<br/>
- [ ] Have students break apart the pattern into its repeating sections. Verify that they all match by lining them up.

<iconp type='question'>How many times does the section repeat itself?</iconp>  
<br/>
- [ ] Build a "loop" with student code blocks

> > "Place one of the repeating sections inside a loop block. Write in the number of times the section repeats."

![cubes-slides](./images/slides-cubes1.jpeg)

- [ ] Repeat the process with the second pattern. This pattern has a piece that is not in the repeating pattern.

> > "Sometimes not everything is part of the pattern."

## 2. Explain: Patterns in Loops (10 min)

- [ ] Handout the code worksheet.

> > “Now we’re going to do the same process to translate a sequence of code to a loop.”

<br/>

- [ ] Explain the "why" of this lesson & show the slide of enemies moving.

> > “This lesson will help us write the code that will make our enemies patrol our maze.”

<br/>
![slides-why](./images/slides-why.jpeg)

- [ ] Identify the repeating section of code.

<iconp type='question'> What is repeating in this pattern? Circle the section of code each time it repeats.</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>See slides</iconp>
<br/>
<iconp type='question'>How many times does the section of code repeat itself?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>See slides</iconp>

<note type='key' title='To Write a Loop:'>
1. Identify the repeating element of a pattern and how many times it repeats.
1. Place the repeating section of code within the loop’s mouth.
1. Place the number of times the pattern repeats as the loop’s argument.
</note>

- [ ] Build a loop in pairs

> > "At your table use your code blocks to build the repeating section of code and place it inside the loop. The argument is the number of repeating sections you have.”

<br/>

- [ ] Show the slides of the loops executing in Scratch.

> > "This is what the enemy looks like when we run our code in Scratch."
<br/>

- [ ] Repeat the process with enemies 2 & 3, but note that not all of the sequence is part of the repeating pattern.

> > "Remember that part of the sequence may not be part of the pattern. Only the repeating pattern belongs inside a loop."

<br/>
- [ ] Challenge students to create their own sequence and translate it to a loop.

> > "Turn over your handout to the other side. Coders love challenges. Here is a challenge for you: write your own sequence that contains a pattern. Then translate it to a loop. You can use the examples we did together and the code blocks at your table to help you out."

<br/>
- [ ] If time ask volunteers to share their sequences and have their teammates try to translate them to loops.
