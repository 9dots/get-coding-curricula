<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students use their game plan to work on their final Escape the Maze project. Classes that do not need the full period to work on their project, and have a full hour for the lesson, are introduced to giving constructive feedback on user experience. They practice giving and incorporating feedback from a peer to improve the user experience of their game.

- When my code fails, I use the debugging protocol to debug my code.
- I can use the editor, block palette, and stage in Scratch to code my program.
- I can give and receive feedback on user experience.

## 1. Engage: Challenges Solved (10 min)

- [ ] **Challenge** students to debug their Independent Coding Challenges as you step through the slides. Encourage students to share their own answers and ask questions before revealing the solutions in the slides. Solutions to challenges 8-10 are shown in movies in the slides. 

> > ‚ÄúIn Lesson 21 you completed a series of coding challenges. Let‚Äôs look at your Independent Coding Challenges together so we can debug any challenges you struggled with and celebrate the challenges you completed without any bugs.‚Äù

**Slides:** ![slide-solutions1](./images/slides-solutions1.jpeg)
![slide-solutions2](./images/slides-solutions2.jpeg)
![slide-solutions3](./images/slides-solutions3.jpeg)

<note type="tip"> Students will be more engaged if you have them lead this activity.</note>

## 2. OPTIONAL: User Experience (15 min) 

- [ ] **Define** user experience. 

> > ‚ÄúUser experience is how a person feels when using a program or product. When designing a game you want to create the best experience for your users. Before we continue on our projects, we are going to get some feedback on user experience.‚Äù

<note type="tip">If your students need the full period to finish their projects you should skip this activity. 
![slide-ux](./images/slides-ux1.jpeg)</note>

- [ ] **Explore:** Play the example game. Have students identify constructive feedback on user experience.

<incop type="question">Which of these are constructive feedback? That means it is helpful.</incop>
	- Your enemies should do more.
		‚õî Not constructive, not specific
	- Enemy 4 is blocking the path. You should move it over.
		üëç Constructive, specific and actionable
	- Move enemy 13 to the white. In the blue it is never an obstacle.
		üëç specific and actionable
	- This game is too hard.
		‚õî Not constructive, not specific
	- This game is boring.
		‚õî Not constructive, not specific
	- I like that all of your enemies are moving.
		üëç it is helpful to know what others like about the game
	- It would be cool if when an enemy touches the hero, then it chases the hero.
		üëç specific and actionable

<iconp type="question">What other feedback might you give this coder?</iconp>

</note>


- [ ] **Practice:** Students play their partner‚Äôs game and give them constructive feedback. Then students share out the feedback they received. Optional: Have students write down the feedback they receive in their idea journals.

> > ‚ÄúYou and your table partner are going to play each other‚Äôs game. Give your partner 2 pieces of feedback: 1) Something you liked about their game. 2) Something they can do to improve their game. Be specific and actionable. I will ask you to share out in 5 minutes so make sure you both share your feedback with each other.‚Äù 

<note> ![slide-practice](./images/slides-ux4.jpeg) </note>

## 3. Elaborate: Project Time (30 min) 

- [ ] **Work time:** Students have the rest of the lesson to work on their final project. 

> > ‚ÄúToday is your last class day to code your Escape the Maze game design. If your plan isn‚Äôt done, complete it first before continuing with your project. You can also get help from our Scratch zine.‚Äù

If you did the User Experience activity: 
> > ‚ÄúRemember to incorporate your user experience feedback as you continue to work on your game.‚Äù

If you introduced bug tickets in lesson 22: 
> > "If you get stuck, fill out a bug ticket to get help from your teammates."

<note> ![slides-zine](./images/slides-zine.jpeg)</note>

## 4. Evaluate: Final Check (5 min)

- [ ] **Final Check:** Open the Final Project studio in Scratch and check that all students have saved their work to the studio before asking them to logout. One way to do this is to have all students stand up and as you read their name out loud they sit down.
