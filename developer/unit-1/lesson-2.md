## Notes
Prior to this lesson pass out the Scratch log-in stickers and have students place them on the inside cover of their idea journals.

This lesson includes several sets of steps that walk students through navigating the
Scratch page. While the lesson includes suggestions for how to chunk them, you should modify the number of steps they are to follow at one time based on your students’ familiarity
with navigating websites and their ability to follow a sequence of instructions
independently.

## Ideal Desk Setup

![Classroom Setup](lesson-2/img/desk-setup.png "Classroom Setup")

## Lesson Resources

If coding is new to your students we suggest showing them the Code.org short [Code
Stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA)   

Pass out idea journals and have students place login stickers on the inside cover of
their journals. Journals should be passed out and collected at the beginning and ending of each class.

{% header title='Do Now', icon='objectives' %}
{% endheader %}

{% length '5 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

Students translate a block code version of “If you give a mouse a cookie”
into a narrative and identify that computer code is different than the narrative
language we use when telling a story or talking to each other.

**Prep:**
- Do Now worksheet

{% table %}

1) Circulate room as students answer the do now on their paper.

2) After 3 minutes ask volunteers to read their interpretations. Read through the blocks so students can hear the sequence flow. Follow up questions for the class:
- Does anyone recognize what book this is from?
- Is this how we talk or tell a story?
- When have you seen a sequence that looks like this before?
- Is the mouse ever going to ask for a straw before it asks for a cookie?

3) Connect the Do Now to the previous lesson in which students used paper code blocks to transport animals across a river.

**Key points:**
- Code is a set of instructions designed to be carried out by a computer.
- In the previous lesson we used paper code to transport animals across a river. We acted as the computer in that lesson.
- In this Do Now the instructions are also in the form of blocks.
- Today we get to explore coding blocks on a computer.

**Key points to hit:**
- The language we use when we program a computer is not the same as the way we speak or write.
- Computers have their own languages and as we become coders we learn to write in the computer’s language.
,,,

1) Students independently answer the do now on their paper
![mouse cookie](lesson-2/img/mouse-cookie.png "Mouse a Cookie")

2) Students raise their hands to volunteer their interpretations of the sequence and answer the follow up questions.
- Answer: If You Give a Mouse a Cookie
- Answer: No
- Answer: we used block code in last week’s lesson to write the instructions for crossing the river
- Answer: No, because the code order determines the order of the story.

3) Students are facing teacher, backs to computers, listening to the teacher’s explanation.

{% endtable %}

{% header title='Logging-in and Exploring', icon='objectives' %}

{% length '10 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

Students log-in and explore the Scratch studio.

**Prep:**
Idea Journals and Log-in Stickers

{% table %}

1) Introduce Scratch as the program we will be using to code.
- Has anyone used Scratch before?
```
Acknowledge students who have. They will be a great
asset to their peers as we all get comfortable navigating
the program.
```

2) Show the [Getting Started with Scratch Video].(https://scratch.mit.
edu/help/videos/#)

3) Point students to their log-in stickers inside their journals.
- Hold up the idea journal to model where they put their stickers.
- If students haven’t put stickers in journals yet, do this now.

4) Remind students of the computer contracts they signed and expectations
while we are on computers:
1. Raise your hand silently if you have a question.
2. When you complete a step give 2 silent thumbs up.
3. Close your laptops all the way when instructed.

5) Step through the 5 steps they will follow on their computer.
- If students are independently computer literate:
- Give the go signal for students to turn and face their com puters.
- Circulate the room helping students who are stuck.
If students are not independently computer literate:
- You may need to teach students how to type an underscore (_)
- Go slide by slide through each step having students complete the slide with you

6) Show the “Make Your Sprite Move Forward” video and give students time to explore the Scratch editor.
- Practice dragging blocks in the script area, connect them, and click the green flag to run their program.
- If a student is more advanced and experienced with Scratch, point them to the challenges in the studio.

Hints in Scratch to share if students are struggling:
- If you don’t know what a block of code does click the ? in the menu bar.
- Click on the top block to drag without separating blocks.
- Clicking the bottom block will detach that piece.

**Attention getting signal**
- What did you learn about Scratch?
- What did you observe in your exploration?
,,,

1) Students are faced away from their computers, towards the teacher.

2) Students watch video on projector.

3) Students hold up their idea journals and point to their stickers.

4) Students practice the 3 expectations.

Students explore the maze project and predict how the code performs in the game

{% table %}

1) Introduce the maze project!
- Who here has done a maze before?
- Who can tell me what is a maze?

Dramatically reveal Escape the maze:
- Part videogame, part maze 
- Students are going to learn to code like app developers!

```
Suggested script:
Now that you played around in the coding editor of Scratch, I’m going to let you in on the big surprise. This year, you’re not just becoming coders, you’re going to learn to code like a game developer! You’re going to build your very own video game: Escape the Maze! I think you are ready to see some of the code right now. 
```
2) Step through navigating to the starter maze and give them 2 minutes to play the game.

3) **Attention getting signal**
- What is happening in the game?
- What happens if the ball touches the blue?
- What does the blue represent?
- What is the green block?
- What happens when the ball gets to the green block?

4) Click             to look at the code inside. Go through each block of code and ask students to connect it to the observations they made above about how the game is performing.
- What is each sequence of blocks telling the program to do?
- Give students 1 minute to discuss with their partners what the code is doing before sharing out.

,,,

1) Students raise their hands to answer question.
Answers should include:
- A path you need to navigate to the end
- A start and an end/goal
- Sometimes there are dead ends or obstacles

a list that we will reference as they develop their projects.

**Prep:**
Chart Paper

{% table %}

1) Brainstorm improving the game and record answers on chart paper or in a document:
- Think about some of the other games that you play. What could we add to Escape the Maze to make it more fun to play?
  * Call on 2 students to share.
  * Give table partners 2 minutes to discuss and write ideas in their idea journals.
  * If a student says they like a particular game (e.g. Pokemon) ask them what features they like about the game (e.g. you can earn points).

2) **Attention getting signal**

Call on students to share out their ideas:
- Continue to record their ideas
- It’s totally okay to write down an idea if your friends come up with it.

3) Close out this section of the lesson by letting students know you are excited about their ideas and the games they will code.
```
Suggested script:
These are all great ideas. We will add them to our game
next time. We will start to build onto the Escape the Maze
game to make it more fun. As you become master coders,
you are going to take over and design your own game.
Keep brainstorming new ideas to put into your game. I
can’t wait to see the games you develop!
```
