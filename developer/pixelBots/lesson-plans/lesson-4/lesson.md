<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students understand that computing is a creative experience and a tool for personal expression. In the next few lessons, students will design and create an emoji in pixelBots that they think a friend or family member will like. Today’s lesson will focus on designing how our pixel emoji will look.



<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>

- Students will use the design thinking process to prototype a pixel emoji on pixelBots.
- Students will use decomposition to identify components of the art.

- **Empathy:** the ability to understand and share the feelings of another
- **Ideate:** generate ideas
- **Prototype:** a first functional form of a new design
- **Plan:** a detailed outline for doing or achieving something
- **Decomposition:** breaking a problem or system into parts that are easier to understand and program

#### Independent Coding Time (30 minutes)
**Note:** If Exit Challenge was completed last week, students go straight to pixelBots playlist.

- [ ] Students do pixelBots Exit Challenge
  - Online students independently solve a pixelBots challenge with panda, chameleon, and toucan to demonstrate mastery of previous lesson. (code: J4R5K)
  >>“Last weekend we practiced coding with arguments with panda, chameleon, and toucan on pixelBots. Complete this challenge independently to show yourself how much you can do.”

<note type="tip" title="Tip">
1. Explain two groups to whole class.
1. Assign who will be in Independent Coding Time group.
1. Give instructions to Independent Coding Time group. Split into groups.
1. Lead 30 minute lesson with 1st group, then switch.</note>

- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students continue on pixelBots playlist from last week
  - Spicy - Code Link: V7BRR
  - Extra Hot - Code Link: V3MQ5

### Group Instruction
#### Engage: Math Eyed Emoji (2 minutes)
**Participation:** Small group with instructor
- [ ] Introduce Pixel Emoji Project.
  - Show Math Eyed Emoji on pixelBots (code: XG31N)
  >>"Today you will design your very own pixel emoji! In the following weeks you will code toucan to paint your emoji in pixelBots and on the last Saturday of devY art you get to showcase your emoji."


#### Explore: Designing Pixel Emojis (25 minutes)

- [ ] Pass out Emoji Design Thinking Handout [Page 1][worksheet1]
- [ ] **Define** Empathize
  - **Modeling:** Teacher thinks of a person he/she wants to create an emoji for and fills out Empathize section of handout on the whiteboard while thinking out loud.
    >>"I am creating an emoji for my dad."
    >>
    >>"My dad likes reading, math and basketball."
    >>
    >>"What I want to convey in this emoji might be my dad’s love for reading, how he always thinks about math, and the feeling of watching his favorite basketball team winning"

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students fill out Empathize section of handout.

- [ ] **Define** Ideate
  -  **Modeling:** Teacher things out loud and the Ideate section of handout, writes ideas for emojis, then sketches some ideas listed.  
    >>“A book, a face with math symbols, excited face, basketball”

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students fill out Ideate section of handout and sketch what their emoji might look like.

- [ ] **Define** Prototype
  - **Modeling:** Show prototype of math face emoji on pixelBots (code: XG31N)

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students prototype their favorite pixel emoji idea on pixelBots (code: VRB42)

- [ ] **Define** Decomposition
  - **Modeling:** Go through Decomposing Art slide

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students decompose their emoji by writing comments in pixelBots.

“Our decomposed emoji will be the plan of how we code our emoji in pixelBots.”

#### Evaluate: Share Pixel Emoji Prototypes (3 minutes)
- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** In pairs, students share their prototype.
