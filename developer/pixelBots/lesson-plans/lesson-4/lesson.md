<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students understand that computing is a creative experience and a tool for personal expression. In the next few lessons, students will design and create an emoji in pixelBots that they think a friend or family member will like. Today’s lesson will focus on designing how our pixel emoji will look.



<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>

- Students will use the design thinking process to prototype a pixel emoji on pixelBots.
- Students will use decomposition to identify components of the art.

- **Empathy:** the ability to understand and share the feelings of another
- **Ideate:** generate ideas
- **Prototype:** a first functional form of a new design
- **Plan:** a detailed outline for doing or achieving something
- **Decomposition:** breaking a problem or system into parts that are easier to understand and program

### 1. Independent Coding Time (30 minutes)

- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students continue on pixelBots playlist from previous lesson. Students choose from: (slides 1-3)
  - Spicy - Code Link: XL9LD
  - Extra Hot - Code Link: VYGND

<note type="tip" title="Tip">
1. Explain two groups to whole class.
1. Assign who will be in Independent Coding Time group.
1. Give instructions to Independent Coding Time group. Split into groups.
1. Lead 30 minute lesson with 1st group, then switch.</note>



### 2. Group Instruction (slide 4)
#### i. Engage: Math Eyed Emoji (2 minutes)
**Participation:** Small group with instructor
- [ ] **Introduce Pixel Emoji Project** with Math Eyed Emoji on pixelBots (code: XG31N) (slide 5)
  >>"Today you will design your very own pixel emoji! In the following weeks you will code toucan to paint your emoji in pixelBots and on the last Saturday of devY art you get to showcase your emoji."


#### ii. Explain: Designing Pixel Emojis (25 minutes)

- [ ] Pass out Emoji Design Thinking Handout [Page 1][worksheet1]
- [ ] **Define** Empathize (slide 6-7)
  - **Modeling:** Teacher thinks of a person he/she wants to create an emoji for and fills out Empathize section of handout on the whiteboard while thinking out loud.
    >>"I am creating an emoji for my dad."
    >>
    >>"My dad likes reading, math and basketball."
    >>
    >>"What I want to convey in this emoji might be my dad’s love for reading, how he always thinks about math, and the feeling of watching his favorite basketball team winning"

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students fill out Empathize section of handout.

- [ ] **Define** Ideate (slide 8-9)
  -  **Modeling:** Teacher things out loud and the Ideate section of handout, writes ideas for emojis, then sketches some ideas listed.  
    >>“A book, a face with math symbols, excited face, basketball”

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students fill out Ideate section of handout and sketch what their emoji might look like.

- [ ] **Define** Prototype (slide 10-11)
  - **Modeling:** Show prototype of math face emoji on pixelBots (code: XG31N)

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students prototype their favorite pixel emoji idea on pixelBots (code: VRB42). Guide students how to get to the emoji prototype challenge (code: XLMK5). (slides 12-14)

- [ ] **Define** Decomposition (slide 15-17)
  - **Modeling:** Go through Decomposing Art slide and show how to use comments in pixelBots.

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students decompose their emoji by writing comments in pixelBots.

>>“Our decomposed emoji will be the plan of how we code our emoji in pixelBots.”

#### iii. Evaluate: Prototypes (3 minutes)
- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** In pairs, students share their prototype.
