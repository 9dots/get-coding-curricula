#### Engage: Zebra Challenge (5 min)
- [ ] Zebra pixelBots offline Challenge (slide 3)
  - On paper students independently solve a pixelBots challenge with Zebra to demonstrate mastery of previous lesson.
>>“Last weekend we practiced coding our zebra pixelBot. Complete this challenge independently to show yourself how much you can do.”

#### Explore: pixelBots - zebra, panda, chameleon (10 min)
- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** pixelBots playlist 1-6 (code link: VR6W3) (slide 5)
  - Students respond to writing prompt in coding journal:
  - What do you notice is different about challenges 3 - 6? (slide 6)

<note type="tip" title="Tip">
If students are stuck on the chameleon, give them a hint that colors need quotes.</note>

- [ ] **Discuss** student observations from pixelBots
  - Whole class discussion.
  - Ask for 2-3 volunteers to share what they noticed about the different challenges.
<note type="tip" title="Tip">Students should start to notice that they can add arguments, but don’t tell them this, let them explore.</note>


####  Explain: Arguments - numbers & strings (5 min)
- [ ] **Define** argument
  - Connect student discussion to the new vocabulary word:  
  >> “Panda and chameleon can be told a number of steps or color. These are called arguments.”

- [ ] Students write definition of Argument in coding journals. (slide 8)

- [ ] **Define** strings
  - Connect student discussion to the new vocabulary word:
  >> “Chameleon took a specific type of argument. What was special about how you wrote the color names?”

- [ ] Students write definition of Strings in journals. Note: strings need quotes. (slide 9)


>> "We can use numbers and strings as arguments when we code Toucan!"

- [ ] **Model** painting a [challenge with Toucan][toucan] (slide 10)
  - Go to pixelBots.io, then enter code link: V3G5X
  - Demonstrate writing a comment with your name as the 1st line of code. Emphasize that this will always be our first line of code in pixelBots from now on.
  - Demonstrate hovering over a square to show the color of the square.
    - Ask if any students noticed this first.
  - Emphasize using the vocabulary words “argument” and “string”.

<note type="tip" title="Tip">
- Spend no more than 3 minutes coding toucan.
- [Finished Toucan code][finishedtoucan] (pixelBots code link: JWR54)
</note>

- [ ] **Model** saving your code by clicking on the save icon in the bottom right.  
  - Remind students that they should save their work and write their code links in their coding journals.

#### Elaborate: pixelBots playlist (20 min)
- [ ] **Independent Practice:** students do pixelBots playlist (slide 12)
  - Students get to choose:
    - [Spicy][spicy] - Code Link: V7BRR
    - [Extra Hot!][extrahot] - Code Link: V3MQ5
  - As you circulate, ask students questions that require them to use the words “argument” and “string”.

<note type="tip" title="Tip">
It’s ok if students don’t complete the entire playlist. Students can continue to work after they’ve completed the Exit Challenge.</note>

#### Evaluate: Exit Challenge (15 min)
- [ ] **Exit Challenge:** Students complete the online [pixelBots challenge][exit] (code link: J4R5K) independently. (slide 14)
  - Remind students to start their code with a comment of their first and last name.
- [ ] Pass out Exit Challenge.
- [ ] Students can continue to work on the pixelBots playlists.
