#### 1. Engage/Explore: Zebra & Friends (15 min)

>>"In our last two lessons, we practiced coding zebra pixelBot. Today we will meet zebra's friends!"

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** pixelBots playlist [Week 3 | Warm-up][warm-up] (code link: VPZZ7) (slide 3)
  - Students respond to writing prompt in coding journal:
  - What do you notice is different about challenges 3 - 6? (slide 4)

<note type="tip" title="Tip">
If students are stuck on the chameleon, give them a hint that colors need quotes.</note>

- [ ] **Discuss** student observations from pixelBots as a whole class
  - Ask for 2-3 volunteers to share what they noticed about the different challenges.
<note type="tip" title="Tip">Students should start to notice that they can add arguments, but don’t tell them this, let them explore.</note>


####  2. Explain: Arguments - numbers & strings (5 min)
- [ ] **Define** argument (slide 8)
  - Students write definition of Argument in coding journals.
  - Connect student discussion to the new vocabulary word:  
  >> “Panda and chameleon can be told a number of steps or color. These are called arguments.”


- [ ] **Define** strings (slide 9)
  - Students write definition of Strings in journals. Note: strings need quotes.
  - Connect student discussion to the new vocabulary word:
  >> “Chameleon took a specific type of argument. What was special about how you wrote the color names?”



<pagebreak/>
- [ ] **Model** painting a [challenge with Toucan][toucan] (slide 10)
  - Go to pixelBots.io, then enter code link: V3G5X
  - Demonstrate writing a comment with your name as the 1st line of code. Emphasize that this will always be our first line of code in pixelBots from now on.
  - Demonstrate hovering over a square to show the color of the square.
    - Ask if any students noticed this first.
  - Emphasize using the vocabulary words “argument” and “string”.
>> "We can use numbers and strings as arguments when we code Toucan!"

<note type="tip" title="Tip">
- Spend no more than 3 minutes coding toucan.
- [Finished Toucan code][finishedtoucan] (pixelBots code link: JWR54)
</note>


#### 3. Elaborate: pixelBots playlist (25 min)
- [ ] **Independent Practice:** students do pixelBots playlist and choose the level of difficulty. (slide 12)
  - [Spicy][spicy] - Code Link: XL9LD
  - [Extra Hot!][extrahot] - Code Link: VYGND
  - Circulate and ask students questions that require them to use the words “argument” and “string”.

<note type="tip" title="Tip">
It’s ok if students don’t complete the entire playlist. Students can continue to work after they’ve completed the Exit Challenge.</note>
<pagebreak/>
#### 4. Evaluate: Exit Challenge (15 min)
- [ ] **Exit Challenge:** Students complete the online [pixelBots challenge][exit] (code link: J4N34) independently. (slide 14)
  - Remind students to start their code with a comment of their first and last name.
  - Students can continue to work on the pixelBots playlists if they complete challenge.
