#### 1. Engage/Explore: Zebra & Friends (15 min)

>>"In our last two lessons, we practiced coding zebra pixelBot. Today we will meet zebra's friends, panda and chameleon!"

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** pixelBots playlist [Week 3 | Warm-up][warm-up] (code link: VPZZ7)
  - Students respond to writing prompt in coding journal:
  - What do you notice is different about challenges 3 - 6?


<note type="tip" title="Tip">
If students are stuck, hint to look at the API and that colors need quotes.
<br/>
**Slides:**
![slides 3-4](./images/engage.png)</note>

- [ ] **Discuss** student observations from pixelBots as a whole class
  - Ask for 2-3 volunteers to share what they noticed about the different challenges.



####  2. Explain: Arguments - numbers & strings (5 min)
- [ ] **Define** argument
  - Students write definition of Argument in coding journals.
  - Connect student discussion to the new vocabulary word:  
  >> “Panda and chameleon can be told a number of steps or color. These are called arguments.”

<note>![slides 6](./images/explain1.png)</note>

- [ ] **Define** strings
  - Students write definition of Strings in journals. Note: strings need quotes.
  - Connect student discussion to the new vocabulary word:
  >> “Chameleon took a specific type of argument. What was special about how you wrote the color names?”

<note>![slides 7](./images/explain2.png)</note>

<pagebreak/>
- [ ] **Model** painting a [challenge with Toucan][toucan]
  - Go to pixelBots.io, then enter code link: V3G5X
  - Demonstrate writing a comment with your name as the 1st line of code. Emphasize that this will always be our first line of code in pixelBots from now on.
  - Demonstrate hovering over a square to show the color of the square.
  - Emphasize using the vocabulary words “argument” and “string”.
>> "We can use numbers and strings as arguments when we code Toucan!"

<note type="tip" title="Tip">
- Spend no more than 3 minutes coding toucan.
![slides 8](./images/model.png)</note>



#### 3. Elaborate: pixelBots playlist (25 min)
- [ ] **Guided Practice:** Do the practice challenge on Spicy playlist together as a class. Call on students to tell you the next line of code.
  <iconp type='question'>What are the arguments in our program? </iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>2, 'lightGreen', 'pink', 'black'</iconp>
<note>![slides 10-11](./images/elaborate.png)</note>


- [ ] **Independent Practice:** students do pixelBots playlist and choose the level of difficulty.
  - [Spicy][spicy] - Code Link: XL9LD
  - [Extra Hot!][extrahot] - Code Link: VYGND
  - Circulate and ask students questions that require them to use the words “argument” and “string”.

<note type="tip" title="Tip">
It’s ok if students don’t complete the entire playlist. Students can continue to work after they’ve completed the Exit Challenge.</note>


#### 4. Evaluate: Exit Challenge (15 min)
- [ ] **Exit Challenge:** Students complete the online [pixelBots challenge][exit] (code link: J4N34) independently.
  - Remind students to start their code with a comment of their first and last name.
  - Students can continue to work on the pixelBots playlists if they complete challenge.
