<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students are introduced to for loops in javascript on pixelBots.io. Students will begin to code their Pixel Emoji Projects and will be able to use for loops to replace a long, repetitive sequence of code.



<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- Students will be able to read a for loop in javascript.
- Students will be able to modify the condition statement and chunk of code in a given for loop to meet the needs of their project.

- **For-Loop:** Specifies the number of times to repeat a sequence of instructions.

#### 1. Engage: Pixel Emoji Projects (5 minutes)
###### Participation: Whole Class

>>"Today you will code your pixel emojis! Before we start, let’s take a quick look at everyone’s emoji prototype."

<br/>
- [ ] **Share out:** Students open their Pixel Emoji Projects on pixelBots.io (slide 1)
  - Students turn computers out to face class.
  - Call on students to share what their emoji is using 1 or 2 words.

<note type="tip" title="Tip">
Keep this quick and snappy to build excitement. Every student should be able to share.
</note>

- [ ] Review two groups (slide 2-4)
  >>“It’s great to see everyone’s project! Today will be another two group lesson. During Independent Coding Time you will begin coding your emoji on pixelBots. In our Group Instruction we will learn about for loops.”

<note type="reminder" title="Reminder">Some students have incomplete prototypes,  that’s okay, they will have time during ICT to finish.</note>

- [ ] Break into two groups.

#### 2. Independent Coding Time: Pixel Emojis (30 minutes)

- [ ] Students finish prototype.
- [ ] Students decompose emoji and write a comment for each feature.
  - Example:
    - // pi eye - blue
    - // division eye - green
    - // mouth - black

<note type="reminder" title="Reminder">
- Remind students how to decompose their emoji. Each decomposed part should be a single color.
- Remind students to code the simple features first.
    </note>

- [ ] Students code one feature at a time.


<pagebreak/>
#### 3. Group Instruction: For Loops
#### i. Explore: Introduction (15 minutes)

- [ ] **Explore:** Students do Lesson 5 playlist on pixelBots (code: V516R) (slide 6)
  - Challenge 1 and 2 are the same, but 2 is done for them using a for loop.
    - Put slide 7 up after students have completed 1 & 2.
    - Ask students to respond to the question in their coding journals.
  - Circulate the room, and narrate what students are doing for challenge 3. Suggested Narration:
  >> "__________ is attempting to write a for loop."
  >> "___________ completed challenge 3, using a for loop."
  >> "___________ copied and pasted the given for loop and is changing the code inside the for loop."
  >> "_________ is changing the number in the for loop."

<note type="tip" title="Tip">
Students will not get through all challenges. Once every student has had a chance to try challenge 3 for 2-3 minutes, quickly move to discussing challenges 1 & 2.</note>

- [ ] **Discuss:** Challenges 1 & 2, code without for loop and code with for loop. (slide 7)
  <iconp type='question'>What do you notice about challenges 1 & 2? </iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>The same picture is painted.</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Challenge 2 code uses less lines of code than 1.</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>The bot moves in a pattern: down, paint, down paint, …</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many times does this sequence of instructions repeat?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>9 times</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Explore:** Students continue working on playlist for 5-8 minutes.

- [ ] **Share out:** Have 1-3 students define For Loop in their own words before showing the definition. (slide 8)

<pagebreak/>
#### ii. Explain: Syntax (5 minutes)

- [ ] **Define** For-Loop: specifies the number of times to repeat a sequence of instructions. (slide 9)
  >> “We can write a for loop to repeat a sequence of code ____ amount of times.”


- [ ] **Model** for loop on challenge 3 through gif (slide 10) (questions: slide 11)
  >> "2 for loops can be used to complete this challenge, one for loop is written for you."

<iconp type='question'>What code is being repeated?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>right(1) & paint(‘amber’)</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many times does it repeat?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>10 times</iconp>
<br/>

<note type="key" title="Key">
Main take away for students on For Loops:
  1. They know how many times the For Loop repeats.
  1. They know what code is being repeated.
</note>

- [ ] **Explain** how we will use for loops in our pixel emoji projects.
  >> "For your projects, you will write your for loop the same way as this example code, but change what code is repeated and how many times it repeats."

<note type="reminder" title="Reminder">
This is an introductory lesson on for loops. By the end of this lesson students should be able to use for loops in their programs, but it is not necessary they fully understand each part of the for loop (initialization, condition statement, and iteration statement).</note>

#### iii. Elaborate: Writing (10 minutes)

- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students practice using for loops on Lesson 5 playlist if they did not finish earlier. (slide 12)
- [ ] **Project:** Students code one feature at a time of their emoji.
  - Students decide if and when to use for loops.
  - After students are working, put slide 13 up so they have example code of a for loop.
