| ------------------|--------------------| -----------|
|[Lesson 01: I Am a Coder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iE9vdDoLf9Rfyp4zFrZLcmOs9_-nKwaSWrsTszYgcs4)|Students work in groups to tackle a challenging problem-solving puzzle and start to discuss on how mistakes are learning opportunities and get us closer to solutions. The pre and post lesson resources reinforce the theme that failure is part of the learning process.

|[Lesson 09: Write Loops III](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-4C6iVSI2Nb2q0uaM63SXVRML1Z8ZzJIh4umtTKpo4M)|In lesson 9, coders will identify the core of a pattern and use a loop block to create more efficient code. Coders will be familiar with identifying patterns through planning code, identifying the core in a pattern, and using the loop block to repeat the core of the pattern.|I can code a sequence of actions I want repeated in a loop.|
|[Lesson 10: Multiple Solutions](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SoF3JMhhiATJsKmvPVhRo2Jgwn-veFQPU6GGDwx7CSk)|In lesson 10, coders use the coding skills they’ve learned to create multiple solutions for one challenge. They will unpack a challenge and discuss their plans before logging into PixelBots to attempt the first challenge in groups. After coders write their code, they will have an opportunity to share and explain their solutions with the whole class. The class will then engage in discussion to compare the multiple solutions presented.|I can write more than one solution to solve a challenge.|

The purpose of this lesson is to help students prepare for their Independent Coding Challenge in Lesson 12. Students will either be coding independently or grouped based on student data captured in PixelBots School. Pauses in the coding time will allow teachers to debrief challenges students are struggling with.|All objectives from lessons 1-10.|
