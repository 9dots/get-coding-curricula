Students begin applying core coding concepts into an Escape the Maze project. In this level, students are introduced to the Scratch block-based language and the offline maze grid. These platforms help student experience and understand new coding concepts such as sequencing, creating loops, and using conditionals.

## Overview: Escape the Maze
In this 27-lesson course, students master computational thinking skills and the fundamentals of coding to build an interactive maze game with multiple obstacles, enemies, and levels. These lessons incorporate unplugged and online activities that build connections between coding concepts and apply them to projects. Along with hard skills in coding, students learn the processes and mindsets of a computer programmer. Students learn to approach failure as an opportunity, collaborate with peers on writing and reviewing code, and tap into their own creativity without reservations. At the end of the course students apply their knowledge of the software design process to plan an unplugged event - a class-wide Arcade Day - in which they share their final maze projects and celebrate their development as a coder.

## Purpose
1. Empower students to use computational thinking practices to analyze problems, build solutions, and be creative.
2. Empower teachers to teach coding / best practices in computational thinking instruction.
3. Empowering students to share code to communicate their thinking , open their thinking up to critique, and revise their thinking.


## Big Goals
1. Students will identify as coders.
2. Students will experience mistakes as learning opportunities.
3. Students will apply core computational thinking concepts (algorithms, pattern recognition, control, and abstraction) to problem solving.
4. Students will be fluent in reading, writing, and debugging code.
5. Students will share, defend, and revise their thinking based on evidence.

## Understandings
- Planning and coding for user experience improves your program.
- Programs can be shared, discussed, critiqued, and revised.
- Programs are built iteratively and collaboratively through a cycle of planning, coding, and validating.
- Bugs in programs are inevitable and can be fixed systematically by comparing, finding, and fixing.
- Coders fearlessly take on problems and challenges and view mistakes as opportunities for reflection and learning.


## Essential Questions
1. How do algorithms, patterns, loops, and conditionals improve communication?
2. How do you incorporate user feedback into your code?
3. What is the most efficient way to fix a bug in my code?
4. How do I learn from a mistake?
5. Why write code that other coders can read?
