<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 3.12, students will be independently completing a playlist based on the objectives learned in lessons 1-10. The purpose of this lesson is for students to demonstrate mastery of skills taught so far through independent coding challenges in the ICC playlist.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can code a sequence of actions in the order I want them performed.
- I can rewrite a repeating sequence with a loop.
- I can code a sequence of actions I want repeated in a loop.
- I can step through and act out code that contains a loop.
- I can use the debugging protocol to debug my code.

- **Bug:** An error in code.
- **Code:** A set of instructions designed to be carried out by a computer.
- **Debugging:** Finding and fixing errors in code.
- **Loop:** A sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
- **Pattern:** A sequence that repeats more than once.

## 1. Introduction (5 min)
- [ ] **Motivate** students for today’s challenge.
>>“Today is an exciting day! Last week we reviewed our coding superpowers and strengthened them.”

- [ ] **Identify** challenge types by looking at the icons on the top left hand corner of the page, next to the Challenge title. Coder should also notice changes in buttons or additions in code blocks.
>>“So far, you learned how to read, write, and debug your code. Today, you will get to use those superpowers to do an Independent Coding Challenge!”

<note type='tip'>
Take some time to recognize and remind students of the tools and skills that they used during the review. Here are some examples:

1. Using the yellow stepper button to debug code.
2. Clicking on each code block when reading code.
3. Finding patterns to identify the core of the loop when writing code.
</note>

## 2. Independent Coding Challenge (35 mins)
- **Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Independent Work Time:** Students log in to PixelBots and complete the Independent Coding Challenge. Students should complete the playlist independently.

- [ ] **Extension:** If students complete the ICC, they can go back to work on any unfinished bonus playlists from Lesson 1-11.

<note type='tip'>
Students should be working independently with no support from teachers or peers to demonstrate independent mastery of coding skills learned thus far.  If students struggle or ask for help, you can:
- encourage them to think of all the strategies they have learned so far (play the code, step through the code, plan the path, etc.)
- have them reference coding resources you provide or that are displayed around room.
</note>

## 3. Reflection (20 min)

- [ ] **Survey:** Students complete a survey using the link provided: [tinyurl.com/coders17][survey]
>>“Coders, you are no longer beginners! Today you showed so much of what you've already mastered this year in coding class. Let’s finish by answering some questions about how you feel as coders before we move on to the next level of coding next week.”
