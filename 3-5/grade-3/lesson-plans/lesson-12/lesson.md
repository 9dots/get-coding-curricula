<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students are introduced to conditionals (if then), practice reading conditional statements in Scratch, and identify how boolean statements are related to conditionals. Students then practice identifying conditional statements in their daily lives.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can identify Boolean statements as ones that evaluate to true or false.
- I can read an if-then statement to execute a sequence if a test is true.

- **Boolean:** A statement that can be "true" or "false".
- **Conditional** Asks a boolean statement, and runs a chunk of code if the answer is true.

## 1. Kids Code (5 min)
Participation: Whole Class Unplugged

- [ ] **Showcase** young student programmer and students to be the next programmer we feature.

> > “Kids all around are coding and creating. You’re never too young to start! If you code a project on your own, we would like to feature your project/app at the start of our class. Code something in Scratch or Code.org or any coding platform and show it to your getCoding teacher.”

<br/>
<note>**Slides:** ![slides-showcase](./images/slides-showcase.png)</note>

- [ ] **Motivate** students by connecting today’s lesson to their Escape the Maze game.

> > “In Lesson 12 when we played the three versions of our Escape the Maze game, what happened when the hero touched an enemy? The hero was sent back to the start! This is caused by conditional statements. Today we will be learning about conditionals, the foundation to programming enemies that react when the hero touches them.”

<br/>

- [ ] **Connecting Prior Knowledge:** Review question #3 from Lesson 13 Exit Challenge.

<iconp type="question"> A lot of coders made this error on their exit challenge last week. When coders get a problem wrong they debug! What was the error here?</iconp>

<iconp type="answer">7 + 3 is not a boolean, it is not a true/false statement and does not have pointed ends</iconp>

## 2. Explore: If Then (5 min)
Participation: Whole Class, Unplugged

- [ ] **Real World Connections:** Students fill in the if/then prompts. Note that there are no right/wrong answers to these.

- If it is raining, then _____________.
- If it is Saturday, then ____________.
- If the light is green, then ______________.
- If the enemy is touching the hero, then _________________.
- If the hero is touching the goal, then ___________________.

<note>![slides-IfThen](./images/slides-IfThen.png)
</note>

- [ ] **Classification:** Ask students to identify what all of the statements had in common.

<iconp type="question">These are called conditional statements. What do conditionals all have in common? </iconp>
<iconp type="answer">They all are “If __________, then ___________" statements.</iconp>

<iconp type="question">What do you notice about all of the “If” statements? Think about our lesson last week. </iconp>
<iconp type="answer">They are all Boolean statements. </iconp>


## 3. Explain: Define (5 min)
Participation: Whole Class, Unplugged

- [ ] **Define** conditionals - students write it in their idea journals

> > “On a blank page in your idea journal let’s write the definition of conditional. Conditional - Asks a true/false (boolean) statement, and runs a chunk of code if the answer is true.”

- [ ] **Check for understanding** -

<iconp type="question"> Which of these blocks are examples of conditionals? </iconp>
<iconp type="answer">The if-then block</iconp>

<iconp type="question"> Which of these blocks are examples of boolean? </iconp>
<iconp type="answer"> 4 is less than 5 </iconp>

<note>![slides-Define2](./images/slides-Define2.png)

**Possible Misconceptions:**
- Students may think a loop is a conditional because of the shape, however a conditional does not repeat on its own.
- Students may think a boolean is a conditional, but a boolean is just a part of a conditional.
- Students may think 4+5 is a boolean because of the color and numbers, but a boolean block has points on the ends and can be answered with True or False.

## 4. Elaborate: Practice (20 min)
Participation: Whole Class, Unplugged

- [ ] **Model** how to use the steps to read conditional statements to read the first few examples on the handout together:
1. Read the If statement.
1. ✔ if the Boolean is true, read and execute what is inside the conditional
1. ✘ if the Boolean is false, skip what is inside the conditional

<note> ![slides-read1](./images/slides-read1.png)</note>

- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students continue to follow the read conditionals steps to finish the examples on the handout. Review the answers together as a class when students are done.

> > “Your turn. Keep following our 3 steps to finish the examples on your paper.”

<note> ![slides-read2](./images/slides-read2.png)
![slides-read3](./images/slides-read3.png)
![slides-challenge](./images/slides-challenge.png)</note>

- [ ] **Challenge** students to write their own conditionals and share them with the class.

>> "Your turn. Write your own conditional to go with the pictures given in #s 6 & 7. Then draw a picture and write a conditional to go with for #s 8 & 9. Try to write one Boolean that is false and one that is true."

## 5. Evaluate: Exit Challenge (10 min)
Participation: Small Group, Independent, Unplugged

- [ ] **Exit Challenge:** Students answer the [Exit Challenge][exit-challenge] on paper using pencil independently and turn it in.

> > “Try these three challenges independently to test your new knowledge of conditionals!”

<note>![slides-Exit](./images/slides-Exit.png)
</note>

## 6. Extension: Independent Coding(15-30 min)

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students move at their own pace through the Code.org studios. If you’d like to give students a more targeted lesson about loops you can direct them to continue working on Code.org Course 2 Lesson 13: Bee Conditionals
