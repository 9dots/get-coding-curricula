## 1. Engage: I Have a Challenge for You (2 min)
Participation: Whole class, unplugged

- [ ] **Call and Response:** teach students the call and response. Teacher says: “I have a challenge for you.” Students say: “Bring it, bring it.”

> > “Before we get started I’m going to teach you a call and response. Whenever you hear me say ‘I have a challenge for you’, you will respond ‘Bring it, bring it’. Let’s try it. ‘I have a challenge for you’ … (students respond ‘Bring it, bring it.’)”

- [ ] **Motivate:** introduce our challenges for today.

> > “You have learned so much as coders since September! Today, working in partners, you get a chance to apply all of your coding skills to tackle a series of challenges."

## 2. Elaborate: Rover (23 min)
Participation: Partners, unplugged

- [ ] **Challenge:** Students move Rover around their grids to practice reading and debugging code with loops and conditionals.

> > "Your first challenge today is to move Rover around the grid to practice reading and debugging code with loops and conditionals. With a partner, carefully read and execute the code on your paper. Afterwards I will ask you to share and defend your answers to the class."

- [ ] **Argumentation:** Use the floor grid to have students act out code. Encourage academic discourse:
	- “I disagree because…”
	- “Show me how you got…”
	- “What line of code…”

## 3. Elaborate: Socrative (20 min)
Participation: Partners, online

- [ ] **Challenge:** Students login to PixelBots to complete a series of challenges similar to the ones they will complete independently on the ICC next week. This is not a test and there is no final score.

> > "Your second challenge today is on PixelBots. As you solve the challenges today, focus on activating all of your new coding super powers.
