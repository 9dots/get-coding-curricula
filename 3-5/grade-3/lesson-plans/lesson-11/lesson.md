<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 3.11, students will be reviewing the objectives learned in lessons 1-10. The purpose of this lesson is to help students prepare for their Independent Coding Challenge in Lesson 3.12. Students will either be coding independently or grouped based on student data captured in PixelBots School. Pauses in the coding time will allow teachers to debrief challenges students are struggling with.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can code a sequence of actions in the order I want them performed.
- I can rewrite a repeating sequence with a loop.
- I can code a sequence of actions I want repeated in a loop.
- I can step through and act out code that contains a loop.
- I can use the debugging protocol to debug my code.

## 1. Review (5 min)
- **Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Introduce** today's lesson to the class.
>>“Today is review day! You are going to practice all the coding skills you’ve learned so far through today’s challenges and talk about them together.”

<note type='tip'>
Be sure to point out the icons, buttons, and goals that change with each type of challenge if students are unable to detect these changes.
</note>

- [ ] **Identify** challenge types by looking at the icons on the top left hand corner of the page, next to the Challenge title. Coder should also notice changes in buttons or additions in code blocks.
>>“So far, you learned how to read, write, and debug your code. Next week, you will get to use those superpowers to do an Independent Coding Challenge!”

## 2. Independent Practice (45 mins)
- **Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students login to PixelBots and begin the 3.11 practice playlist.

- [ ] **Target** students who need teacher support by pulling small groups based data found in PixelBots School.

- **Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Review** at least two challenges with all students after they have worked through challenges 1 through 5 independently. Select challenges for review based on your class’ specific needs. Use the questions below to guide the discussion. See below for challenge numbers.

<note type='tip'>
Circulate heavily and use the PixelBots Schools to create small groups by:
- identifying students that are stuck on the same challenge.
- identifying groups of students who completed the challenge, but did not meet the target goal.
</note>

- [ ] **Challenge 1, 6 (writing code):**
<iconp type='question'>What do you want the PixelBot to paint?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Coders should identify the number of blocks they need to paint and where they are located.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How should the PixelBot get to the squares it needs to paint?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Coders should explain how the code blocks in the sequence will get the PixelBot to the squares.</iconp>
<br/>

<note type='tip'>
After asking the challenge-specific questions, have students share out how they read, wrote, or debugged that specific challenge. You can:
- code along as students share out
- display student code through the PixelBots Schools as they explain it.

If majority of students demonstrate ability to solve challenges independently, meet with all students to discuss coder strategies and thinking when writing loops
</note>

- [ ] **Challenge 2, 7 (writing loops with prewritten code):**
<iconp type='question'>Do you see a pattern? What is the core of the pattern (the part that is being repeated)? How many times does the core repeat?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Coders should explain what code blocks make up the pattern and how many times it repeats.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What block will be helpful to write the code?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>A loop block.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Why do you want to use a loop block?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>It shortens our code. Instead of writing the code repeatedly which would take a long time, we can take the core of the pattern and nest it inside of a loop.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What should go inside of the loop?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>The core of the pattern. (Coders should explain what code blocks make up the core of the pattern in sequence).</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many times should it repeat?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What should we do with the rest of the code that is not in the loop?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Delete it.</iconp>
<br/>
- [ ] **Challenge 3, 8 (writing loops):**
<iconp type='question'>Do you see a pattern? What is the core of the pattern (the part that is being repeated)?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Coders should explain what code blocks make up the pattern.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What block will be helpful to write the code?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>A loop block.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Why do you want to use a loop block?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>It shortens our code. Instead of writing the code repeatedly which would take a long time, we can take the core of the pattern and nest it inside of a loop.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What should go inside of the loop?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>The core of the pattern. (Coders should explain what code blocks make up the core of the pattern).</iconp>
<br/>
<note type='tip'>
Stop and review as needed but make sure to provide plenty of time for students to try solving the challenge independently.
<br/>
Review in small groups if only a handful of students are stuck on a challenge or have the same misconceptions.
</note>

- [ ] **Challenge 4, 9 (reading loops):**
<iconp type='question'>What mistakes might you make when reading a sequence?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Painting the wrong square, turning the wrong direction, moving the wrong number of steps.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many times do we have to repeat this sequence of code?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Coders should identify how many times the loop will repeat.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What tools can we use to ensure that we are reading the code correctly?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We can click on each line of code to highlight it. (This helps us keep track of where we are as we read through the sequence).</iconp>
<br/>
- [ ] **Challenge 5, 10 (debugging code):**
<iconp type='question'>What do you want the PixelBot to do? What does it do instead?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Coders explain what is wrong with the code and what the goal is telling us to paint.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What tools can we use to find the bug?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We can use the green play button to identify what the PixelBot is doing wrong.</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We can use the yellow stepper tool to identify where the bug is.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What can we do after we’ve found the bug?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We can delete the code and replace it.</iconp>
<br/>
- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students continue the 3.11 Practice playlist. If finished, students can begin the 3.11 Bonus playlist. If you determine that students need further review, pull a small group or meet back in whole group.

## 3. Reflection (10 min)
- **Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Think-Pair-Share:** Students share their responses to the questions below with a partner. After each partner has shared, call on students to share with the rest of the class.

<iconp type='question'>How did you feel when you were coding today? Why?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What skill do you think you’ve done really well on?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What skill do you want to keep practicing?</iconp>
