<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 3.13, students will be introduced to conditionals. They will explore conditionals using the “IF, then” block in PixelBots and by working independently to solve “read” challenges.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can step through a conditional to determine what a program does.

- **Conditional:**  A boolean expression that determines which sequence of code to perform.

## 1. Engage: Observe & Unpack (10 min)
- **Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Reveal and Unpack** the demo challenge. Students should notice that there is a new block in PixelBots.
>>“Coders, take the next 20 seconds to notice and wonder about this demo challenge.”

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do you notice any blocks in the code that we haven’t used yet?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>The block that says “IF”.</iconp>
<br/>
  >>“There is a new block that we haven’t worked with yet. It is this ‘IF’ block here.”

<br/>
<note type='tip'>
Students will be unpacking a “write” and “read” version of one challenge. The students will act out what they think their bots will do with a “read” challenge during exploration.
<br/>
The result of the “write” challenge will be revealed in whole group after exploration.
</note>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have students make predictions about what this new code block might do.

<iconp type='question'>What do you think the “IF” block does?</iconp>
<br/>
- [ ] **Write** student’s predictions on the board.

<note type='tip'>
You will refer back to these predictions after students try Challenge 1.
</note>

- [ ] **Reveal** Challenge 1.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Students should notice that their challenge is a reading challenge, not a writing challenge.</iconp>

## 2. Explore: Try It Out (5 mins)
- **Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Challenge** students to discover what the “IF” block does independently.
>>“Now you get to try out your predictions with Challenge 1 for 5 minutes. Afterward, we will meet whole group to share out what the ‘IF’ block actually does.”

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students step through the code to discover what the “IF” block does.

<note type='tip'>
Emphasizing time constraints may be important here, as it can lessen the impact of the initial frustration students may experience during the Explore.
</note>

## 3. Explain: Conditionals (20 mins)
- **Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Share Out:** Ask students to show you whether or not they still agree with their predictions. Go through each prediction and have one students share why they still agree with the prediction.

<iconp type='question'>Do you still agree with your prediction? Why?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Reveal** what the “IF” block does by running the Demo Challenge.

- [ ] **Think-Pair-Share:** Have students share their discoveries and noticings with another student, then have one student share out what the “IF” block did.

<iconp type='question'>What do you think the “IF” block did?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Explain** “conditionals”
>>“A conditional only runs under certain situations. For example: If it’s cold outside, then wear a jacket...”

- [ ] **Model** everyday examples of “IF, then” statements.
  -  IF it is cold outside, then wear a jacket.
  -  IF the street light is red, then stop.
  -  IF coding is challenging, then keep practicing

- [ ] **Share Out:** have students share their own.

<iconp type='question'>If it’s raining, then…</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>...I need an umbrella</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>If you receive a gift, then…</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>...you say thank you.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>If you find a pattern in your code, then…</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>...you use a loop to make your code more efficient!</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge 2.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do you think this code will do?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Model** how to step through Challenge 2.
>>“I notice that the first line of code is an ‘IF’ conditional block. It reads, if green, then paint brown. My PixelBot is not on the color green so this ‘IF’ conditional block is false. My PixelBot does not act out the code in the ‘IF’ block. The next line after the ‘IF’ block is move forward two steps, then paint green.”

- [ ] **Explain** that our ‘IF’ conditional blocks can be true or false.
>>“If it’s raining, we need an umbrella, but if it’s not raining, we don’t need it. The same goes for ‘IF’ blocks in code. If what our ‘IF’ block is checking for is not true, then our PixelBot does not act out the code inside the ‘IF’ block.”

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBots Practice (20 mins)
- **Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students work independently to solve the rest of the “read” challenges in the practice playlist. Students can continue on to the Bonus challenges in the playlist once they are done with the first 10 challenges.
<note type='tip'>
Consider pulling small groups for coders who need extra support.
<br/>
When facilitating debugging:
1. Allow coders to find the bug themselves.
2. Only the coders control the mouse.
3. Teacher models debugging process and asks coders questions to find the solution together.
4. Coders know that it's okay if they don't know the bug or how to solve it!
</note>

## 5. Evaluate: Reflection (5 mins)
- **Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Reflect** on the question below in whole group.

<iconp type='question'>How do you feel about coding class today?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How you think “conditionals” work?</iconp>
