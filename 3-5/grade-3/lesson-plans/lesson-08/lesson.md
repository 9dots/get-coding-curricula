<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In Lesson 8 students use pattern recognition to write loops. Students practice identifying the core of a pattern and the number of times it repeats in order to rewrite a sequence of code with a loop.

- I can rewrite a repeating sequence with a loop.

## 1. Engage: Observe & Unpack (5 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** challenge number 1 from the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge as a class.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about this challenge?**</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing? (up, down, left, right)</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What color does it need to paint the squares?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many code blocks do we have to use?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Do you see any patterns</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the core of the pattern?</iconp>

## 2. Explore: Try It Out (5 min)
- [ ] **Challenge** the class to rewrite the code to complete the challenge within the line limit stretch goal.

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students rewrite the code to meet the line limit stretch goal.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class to find students that can be called on to share their strategies in the next activity.

## 3. Explain: Repeat Your Code (10 min)
- [ ]  **Pair-Share:** Students discuss the strategies they tried to meet the line limit stretch goal.

<iconp type='question'>How did you rewrite the code?</iconp>

- [ ] **Review** repeating code with loops from the previous lesson.
>>"In our last lesson we saw how we can loop the core of a pattern to shorten our code. In order to loop our code, we first find the core of the pattern and then count the number of times it repeats. We can then put the core in a loop and tell the computer to repeat it the number of times we counted."

- [ ] **Model** rewriting the code to meet the line limit with loops.
>>"In our first challenge, the core of the pattern is step and paint. This core repeats 4 times. In order to loop this code 4 times, I can select the two blocks that make up the core and click the loop block. Then I can change the number in the loop to 4 so that it repeats the sequence 4 times."

- [ ] **Explain** how to wrap existing code within a loop.
>>"We can put the core of a pattern in the loop by selecting the blocks that make up the core. After we have selected them we can click on the loop block to wrap them in a loop. Since we no longer need the rest of the code, we can just delete it."

- [ ] **Unpack** challenge 2 as a class.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about this challenge?**</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing? (up, down, left, right)</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What color does it need to paint the squares?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many code blocks do we have to use?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Do you see any patterns</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the core of the pattern?</iconp>

- [ ] **Guided Practice:** Solve challenge 2 as a class by having students respond to the questions below. As students share out, try their ideas from your computer until the group has solved the challenge.

<iconp type='question'>Which part of the code should go in the loop? Why?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many times should the code repeat in the loop?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How do I add the code to the loop?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How do I get rid of the rest of the code?</iconp>

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBot Practice (25 min)
- [ ]  **Independent Coding:** Coders work through the rest of the challenges in the playlist.

- [ ]  **Ask** the following questions to guide students who are struggling
  <iconp type='question'>What did you want your program to do?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is it doing instead?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What have you tried? (Prompt students to use the stepper tool and talk through what's happening at each step.)</iconp>

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBots bonus playlist.

## 5. Evaluate: Reflect  (10 min)
-  [ ] **Reflect** on the question below in whole group

  <iconp type='question'>How do you feel about coding class today?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>When are loops useful in coding?</iconp>
