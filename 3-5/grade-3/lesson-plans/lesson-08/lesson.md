- **Bug:** An error in code.
- **Debugging:** Finding and fixing errors in code.
- **Loop:** A sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.

## 1. Engage: Predictions (5 min)
- [ ] **Think Pair Share:** Open the demo challenge on pixelBots and display the code. Ask the class to predict what the pixelBot will do when the run button is clicked.
>>“Take a close look at the pixelBot code. Before I run this code, make a prediction of what this code will do. Turn to your table partner and share your prediction. Then I will ask a few groups to share out.”

<iconp type='question'>What do you think the pixelBot will paint when I press the run button?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What makes you think that will happen?</iconp>

- [ ] **Discuss** the strategies students used to make their predictions using the question below.

<iconp type='question'>What did you see in the code that allowed you to make a prediction without stepping through the code?</iconp>

## 2. Explore: Buggy Loops (10 min)
- [ ] **Challenge** the class to debug the code in pixelBot challenges 1 and 2. Students work on the challenges without any teacher assistance.
>>“Coders, I have a challenge for you. Your goal is to make the code paint what you see in the target grid without deleting anything. Let’s open our computers and type in the code to today’s pixelBots playlist.”

- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Have students discuss the strategies they tried to find and fix bugs in the code.

<iconp type='question'>What steps did you take to make sure the code worked?</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have volunteers share out the their strategies with the class and record their responses on the board.
Categorize: Ask students to look at the strategies written on the board and categorize where they fall in the compare, find, try debugging protocol.
>>“The steps to our debugging protocol are compare, find, and try.”

<iconp type='question'>Which of the strategies that we described fall under compare?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which of the strategies that we described fall under find?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which of the strategies that we described fall under try?</iconp>


## 3. Explain: Compare, Find, Try (10 min)
- [ ] **Model** using the debugging protocol to debug pixelBot challenge number 3.
>>“When we debug code we follow three basic steps: (1) Compare (2) Find (3) Try. Let's try it with this challenge. First Compare:"

<iconp type='question'>What do we want our program to do?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We wanted it to paint the 4 gray squares to make one big square.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What does it do instead?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>It painted 4 squares to make a larger square in the wrong spot.</iconp>

>>"Step two, Find: We can use the yellow stepper tool to find where the bug might be."

<iconp type='question'>Where in the code do you think the bug is located? Let’s click the yellow stepper tool until we get there.</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>On line 4 the bug turns left.</iconp>

>>“Step three, Try:"

<iconp type='question'>What solution should we try? If the solution we try doesn’t work we choose another solution and try it out.</iconp>

- [ ] **Guided Practice:** Have students attempt to debug pixelBot challenge number 4 on their own.
>> “You are going to try this next challenge on your own. Your goals is to find the bug and fix it by using the debugging protocol. ”

- [ ] **Share solutions:** Ask students how they answered each step of the debugging protocol to debug the challenge.
<iconp type='question'>Compare: What do we want our code to do? What does it do instead?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Find: Where in the code might the bug be located?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Try: What solution did you try? Did it work?</iconp>

## 4. Elaborate: Independent Debugging (15 min)
- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students apply the debugging protocol to a series of challenges. During this time circulate to assist students in need of additional help.
>>“Alright coders, now it’s your turn. Continue to use our 3 steps to debug the remaining challenges.”

- [ ] **Share solutions** for debugging challenge numbers 4 and 5 as a class. Have students project their solutions. Encourage the class to respond with "I agree because..." and "I disagree because..."

<iconp type='question'>Compare: What do we want our code to do? What does it do instead?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Find: Where in the code might the bug be located? I will give you a few minutes to step through the code and find what line you think has the bug.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Try: What solution did you try? Did it work?</iconp>

## 5. Evaluate ( min)
- [ ] **Exit Challenge:** Students complete the exit challenge independently.
