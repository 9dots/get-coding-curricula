## 1. Engage: Let's Get Moving! (7 min)
- [ ] **Explain:** Teach students the rules for a quick movement activity. Students will be shown statements on the projector and they will walk to the side of the room that has the response they identify with (i.e. Confident, I could use a little more help, I’m so confused). Each statement is based on an objective that they have learned in Lessons 1-8.
>>“Today I want to start by doing a movement activity with you. When I show you a statement on the projector, you are going to walk to the side of the room that you identify with. You can go to the right wall if you feel ‘Confident’. The left wall if you feel ‘So confused!’ or you can stand in the middle if you ‘could use a little more help!’ Remember safety: we always walk and we keep our hands to ourselves. It’s not a race! “

- [ ] **Motivate:** After students finish movement activity, have them come back together whole group.
>>“Each statement you just saw is something that ALL of you coders have already learned! Today you are going to get a chance to apply all of your new skills to some challenges. Think about which side of the room you stood on for each of those statements. If you found yourself in the ‘I’m so confused’ section for any of the statements, don’t be afraid to raise your hand and ask for help or ask a classmate. Let’s get started!”


## 2. Elaborate: Rover (23 min)
- [ ] **Challenge:** Students move rover around their grids to practice reading and debugging code with loops.
>>“Your first challenge today is to move Rover around the grid to practice reading and debugging code with loops. With a partner, carefully read and execute each code on your paper.. Afterwards, I will ask you to share and explain your code to the class.”

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have students share and explain their code to the class for each challenge. Encourage academic discourse:
  - I agree/disagree ...because…
  - I have a question about that.
  - My idea is similar to/related to  _____’s idea.

<iconp type='question'>Questions to Facilitate Discussion:</iconp>
  - Example 1: Is there more than one way to code this challenge? Are they both correct? (Think about efficiency)
  - Example 2: What strategies did you use to step through the code?
  - Example 3: What strategies did you use to debug the code?
  - Example 4: What is the benefit of using a loop?
  - Example 5 (Extension): How was this challenge different than example 4? Why was it harder? What strategy did you use to address this difficulty?
## 3. Elaborate Part II: PixelBots (20 min)
- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students login to PixelBots to complete a series of challenges involving the skills they have learned in lessons 1-8. Discuss the answers with students after each question. Encourage academic discourse.
>> “Your next big challenge for today is on PixelBots. Remember to tap into ALL of the coding skills that you have learned so far this year as you answer each question. We will pause after each question to go over the answer before moving on to the next question.”

## 4. Evaluate: Reflection (10 min)
- [ ] **Reflect:** Have students reflect in their coding notebooks about their work from today.
>>“In the beginning of class, you rated how comfortable you felt about different skills that we have learned so far this year. In your notebooks, take a few minutes to write down any coding skills that you now feel more comfortable with after today’s review. Also reflect on where you still want to grow!”

  - Sentence Starters:
    - "After today’s review, I feel more comfortable to ______________."
    - "I still want to work on  ________."
