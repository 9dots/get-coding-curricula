<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In Lesson 9, coders will identify the core of a pattern and use a loop block to create more efficient code. Coders will be familiar with identifying patterns through planning code, identifying the core in a pattern, and using the loop block to repeat the core of the pattern.

- **Code:** A set of instructions designed to be carried out by a computer.
- **Loop:** A sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
- **Pattern:** A sequence that repeats more than once.
- **Sequence:** A set of actions that must be performed in the order they are written.

## 1. Engage: Observe & Unpack (5 min)
**Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Introduce** coders to today’s lesson.
>>“The last few weeks you’ve been practicing writing loops from patterns. Today we’re going to practice writing a loop from scratch.”

- [ ] **Reveal** the first challenge of the day
>>“Coders, take the next 20 seconds to notice and wonder about today’s first challenge”

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge as a class by asking students what they notice about the challenge, guiding them to notice that there is a pattern in the code as a whole group.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about this challenge?**</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing? (up, down, left, right)</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What color does it need to paint the squares?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What pattern do you see?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many code blocks do we have to use?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many lines of code do we need to use to solve this challenge? (the stretch goal above the code editor)</iconp>

<note type='tip'>Ensure that coders  are contributing to the conversation with any and all observations to guide them to the:


- Goal of the challenge
- Position of the PixelBot
- Orientation of the PixelBot
- Presence of starter code
- Code blocks available


As coders are making observations, validate their noticings with a “Thank you” or nod of the head to avoid evaluating with “Correct” or “Incorrect”. You can also write student noticings on the board as a means to validate coders.
<br/>
This helps to make coders feel comfortable with contributing while still refraining from validating just one way of thinking or solution
<br/>
Ask the follow up questions if the initial noticing question doesn’t drive students to think deeper about the challenge.</note>

## 2. Explore: Try It Out (10 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to write code that will paint our goal with only 3 lines of code blocks.
>>“Challenge yourself to write code that only uses 3 code blocks to paint our goal independently.”

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have coders write code to paint the goal.

<note type='tip'>Monitor the class to find identify student challenges that incorporate the loop block to display in the next part of the lesson. Also, look for coders who are using various coding tools such as the stepper tool, the layover tool, and the copy and paste tool.</note>

## 3. Explain: Patterns to Loops (20 min)
**Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Think-Pair-Share:** Coders share strategies they tried to write no more than 3 lines of code for the first challenge in pairs. 2-3 coders share out strategies they tried.

<iconp type='question'>What tools and strategies did you use to solve today’s challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>I used the loop block to repeat the pattern to paint my goal.</iconp>

- [ ] **Explain** how to find patterns by planning code while reviewing the first challenge.

1. Plan the Code
>>“We need to know what the core of the pattern is. To find the core of the pattern, we first look at our goal. After we know our goal, we must plan how we would code it. As we plan, we can use our yellow stepper tool or our green run button to check our code.”

1. Find the Core
>>“To find the core of our pattern, we need to know how many blocks make a pattern. We see that 2 blocks make a pattern. Our first block is Move 1 Step and our last block is Paint. Now we’ve found our core.”

- [ ] **Introduce** Challenge 2.
>>“Today’s challenges require you to identify a pattern in the goal and use the pattern to create loops that will reduce the number of code blocks we use to paint the goal.”

- [ ] **Unpack** challenge 2 as a class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing? (up, down, left, right)</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What color does it need to paint the squares?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What pattern do you see?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many lines of code do we need to use to solve this challenge? (the stretch goal above the code editor)</iconp>

<note type='tip'>Ask coders to respond to other coders’ responses with non verbal cues such as a thumbs up or a pat on the head to signal that they too tried that same strategy or tool. That way, more voice will feel heard.</note>

- [ ] **Model** writing code for Challenge 2 by identifying the pattern and using the loop tool.

1. Plan the code by writing out what the pixelbot needs to do. Then, run the code.
1. Find the pattern core in the plan by identifying the start of the pattern and the end of the pattern.
1. Use the loop tool and copy and paste the core of the plan.
1. Delete excess code and run the code.

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBot Practice (10 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Coders work through the rest of the challenges in the playlist.

<note type='tip'>Consider pulling small group for coders who need extra support.

When facilitating debugging:
1. Allow coders to find the bug themselves.
1. Only the coders control the mouse.
1. Teacher models debugging process and asks coders questions to find the solution together.
1. Coders know that it's okay if they don't know the bug or how to solve it!</note>

Ask the following questions to guide students who are struggling

<iconp type='question'>What did you want your program to do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is it doing instead?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What have you tried? (Prompt students to use the stepper tool and talk through what's happening at each step.)</iconp>

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBots bonus playlist.

## 5. Evaluate: Reflect (5 min)
**Location:** Rug

- [ ]  **Reflect** on the question below in whole group

<iconp type='question'>How do you feel about coding class today?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>When are loops useful in coding?</iconp>
