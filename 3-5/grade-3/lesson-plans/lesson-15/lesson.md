<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 3.15, students use the coding skills they’ve learned to create multiple solutions for one challenge. They will unpack a challenge and discuss their plans before logging into PixelBots to attempt the first challenge in groups. After coders write their code, they will have an opportunity to share and explain their solutions with the whole class. The class will then engage in discussion to compare the multiple solutions presented.

- **Code:** A set of instructions designed to be carried out by a computer.
- **Loop:** A sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
- **Pattern:** A sequence that repeats more than once.
- **Sequence:** A set of actions that must be performed in the order they are written.
- **Conditional:** A true-false statement that determines whether or not a chunk of code will run.

## 1. Engage: Unpack (5 mins)
- **Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Explain** the purpose of today’s lesson. Begin by using the slideshow to review some of the blocks and tools that students have learned to use so far.
>>“Today we are going to use everything we have learned so far and focus on just two different challenges. You are going to have an opportunity to solve Challenge 1 in more than just one way with a team of coders. Then, we will share out the different code solutions you came up with. Afterward, we will independently try Challenge 2 to solve it with different code solutions.”

<note type='tip'>
Guide students to the:

- Goal of the challenge
- Position of the PixelBot
- Orientation of the PixelBot
- Presence of starter code
- Code blocks available
<br/>
As coders are making observations, validate their noticings with a “Thank you” and avoid evaluating with “Correct” or “Incorrect”. Validate coders by writing their noticing on your copied slide/whiteboard. Ask the follow up questions if the initial noticing question doesn’t drive students to think deeper about the challenge.
</note>

- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge One as a whole class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice?</iconp>
<br/>
<iconp type='question'>What do we want the PixelBot to do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What colors can the squares be?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do you see any patterns?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Think-Pair-Share:** Have students think for 20 seconds and then turn to their partner to discuss the path they plan on coding for the PixelBot. Then share out whole group.

<iconp type='question'>What is your plan?</iconp>
<br/>
<iconp type='question'>What would you do first? What else could you do first?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What code block can we use to change the color of a square?</iconp>
<br/>

## 2. Explore: Try It Out (10 mins)
- **Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Challenge**: Students login to PixelBots and solve the first challenge two different ways. (They will complete Challenge 1A and 1B).
>>“Okay coders, it’s time to login and write the code for Challenge One. You are going to have 10 minutes to solve the challenge in 2 different ways on a shared computer with a partner.”

<note type='tip'>
Pre-work:  Before the lesson, jot down as many solutions that you can come up with for Challenge 1. Then look for coders around the classroom that have used these solutions. As you identify coders who can share their solutions, prepare them by asking them questions to explain their code. The goal is to get coders to explain their code in more detail.
<br/>
Examples:
- Why did you use this block?
- How did you know to step three times?
- Why did you choose to solve it this way?
</note>

- [ ] **Monitor** as students work on a shared computer with a partner. Look for students who’ve used different solutions, specifically “IF” conditionals. Once you’ve found a student that has discovered two different solutions (one that includes the loop block), pause the exploration to come back together as a whole group.

## 3. Explain: Comparing Code (15 mins)
- **Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Share Out:** Display one of the two solutions that a pair wrote for Challenge 1 (Challenge 1A and 1B). Have one partner explain how they solved challenge 1A. Then, have the other partner explain challenge 1B

<note type='tip'>
In the slideshow, sentence starters are displayed to help coders explain their code.
<br/>
Example:
- I want my PixelBot to…
- I knew I needed _____ to...
- I used _____ because…
- I noticed my pattern was…

Ask the follow up questions if the initial explanation is not sufficient in communicating the steps the student took to solve their challenge. If students struggle to explain their code, go ahead and model solving the challenge with the student.
</note>

<iconp type='question'>Explain how you solved your challenge.</iconp>
<br/>
<iconp type='question'>What was the goal? What picture did you want your PixelBot to paint?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>I wanted my PixelBot to move in the shape of a flower and it had to be yellow.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What plan did you write for the PixelBot to follow?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>I used an IF conditional block and a switch block to make sure that the block switched to yellow if it was blue. Then I knew I had to move 1 step, turn right, and move one step to get to the next square. Once I got there, I saw that I needed to use an If block with the switch block again.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Does your code have a pattern? What is being repeated?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>I noticed my pattern was switch, move 1 step, turn right, move 1 step.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What types of code blocks did you use after you found the pattern?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>I used a loop because I saw that I could repeat the core 4 times.</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Think-Pair-Share:** Display the two solutions in different windows and make sure one of the solutions includes an “IF” conditional. Have students turn and talk to compare the various solutions.

<iconp type='question'>If you were to code this only one time, which solution would you code? Why?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge Two as a whole class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice?</iconp>
<br/>
<iconp type='question'>What do we want the PixelBot to do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do you see any patterns?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Think-Pair-Share:** Have coders think for 20 seconds and then turn to their partner to discuss the path they plan on coding for the PixelBot. Then share out whole group.

<iconp type='question'>What is your plan?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What would you do first? What else could you do first?</iconp>

## 4. Elaborate: Multiple Solutions (10 mins)
- **Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Coders login to PixelBots and solve Challenge 2 in two different ways. (They will complete Challenge 2A and 2B).

<note type='tip'>
Consider pulling small group for coders who need extra support.
<br/>
When facilitating debugging:
- Allow coders to find the bug themselves.
- Only the coders control the mouse.
- Teacher models debugging process and asks coders questions to find the solution together.
- Coders know that it's okay if they don't know the bug or how to solve it!
</note>

- [ ] **Monitor** coders as they work. Look for coders who used different solutions and jot their names down, so you can display their code during the follow up discussion.

## 5. Evaluate: Share and Reflect (15 mins)
- [ ] **Share Out:** Display the various solutions that pre-selected coders from the Elaborate section used. Have each coder explain their code to the class.

<iconp type='question'>Explain how you solved the challenge.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What other ways did you try? (Pull up a different challenge on their playlist and have them explain their code.)</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Whole Group Discussion:** Display the solutions in different windows, so coders can see them all. Have coders engage in discussion to compare the various solutions just as they did with Challenge One.

<iconp type='question'>How are these solutions different?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How are they the same?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which solution do you like? Why?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Reflect** on the questions below in whole group.

<iconp type='question'>How did you feel about coding class today?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What did you learn today?</iconp>
