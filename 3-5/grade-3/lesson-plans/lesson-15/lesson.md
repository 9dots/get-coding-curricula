## 1. Engage: Predictions (5 min)
- [ ] **Think Pair Share:** Open the demo challenge on pixelBots and display the code. Ask the class to predict what the pixelBot will do when the run button is clicked.
>>“Take a close look at the pixelBot code. Before I run this code, make a prediction of what this code will do. Turn to your table partner and share your prediction. Then I will ask a few groups to share out.”

<iconp type='question'>What color square will the pixelBot stop on?</iconp>

- [ ] **Discuss** the strategies students used to make their predictions using the question below.

<iconp type='question'>What did you see in the code that allowed you to make a prediction without stepping through the code?</iconp>

## 2. Explore: Challenge (5 min)
- [ ] **Challenge** the class to debug the code in pixelBot challenge 1. Students work on the challenges without any teacher assistance.
>> “Coders, I have a challenge for you. The goal is to make the code change the color of the blue squares to green and to keep all of the pink squares pink. Let’s open our computers and type in the code to today’s pixelBots playlist.”

- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Have students discuss the strategies they tried to find and fix bugs in the code.

<iconp type='question'>What was the bug in the code?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How did you find the bug?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What did you try to do to fix it?</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have 1-2 volunteers share out the their strategies with the class. Try out each student’s solution on the board.

## 3. Explain: Debugging Protocol (10 min)
- [ ] **Model** using the debugging protocol to debug pixelBot challenge number 2.
>>“When we debug code we follow three basic steps: (1) Compare (2) Find (3) Try. Let's try it with this challenge. First Compare:"

<iconp type='question'>What do we want our program to do?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We want the program to paint all of the yellow squares pink and to keep all of the green squares green.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What does it do instead?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>It is not painting yellow squares pink.</iconp>

>>"Step two, Find: We can use the yellow stepper tool to find where the bug might be."

<iconp type='question'>Where in the code do you think the bug is located? Let’s click the yellow stepper tool until we get there.</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>On line 5 the code checks if the square is green and paints it green instead of checking if the square is yellow.</iconp>

>>“Step three, Try:"

<iconp type='question'>What solution should we try? If the solution we try doesn’t work we choose another solution and try it out.</iconp>

- [ ] **Guided Practice:** Have students attempt to debug challenge number 3 on their own.
>>“You are going to try this next challenge on your own. Your goals is to find the bug and fix it by using the debugging protocol. ”

- [ ] **Share solutions:** Ask students how they answered each step of the debugging protocol to debug the challenge.

<iconp type='question'>Compare: What do we want our code to do? What does it do instead?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Find: Where in the code might the bug be located?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Try: What solution did you try? Did it work?</iconp>

## 4. Elaborate: pixelBot Challenges (20 min)
- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students apply the debugging protocol to a series of challenges. During this time circulate to assist students in need of additional help.
>>“Alright coders, now it’s your turn. Continue to use our 3 steps to debug the remaining challenges.”

- [ ] **Share solutions** for debugging challenge numbers 4 and 5 as a class. Have students project their solutions. Encourage the class to respond with "I agree because..." and "I disagree because..."

<iconp type='question'>Compare: What do we want our code to do? What does it do instead?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Find: Where in the code might the bug be located? I will give you a few minutes to step through the code and find what line you think has the bug.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Try: What solution did you try? Did it work?</iconp>

## 5. Evaluate: Exit Challenge (5 min)
- [ ] **Exit Challenge:** Students complete the exit challenge independently.
