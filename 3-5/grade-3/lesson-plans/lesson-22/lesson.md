Students are introduced to the debugging protocol and practice applying it to a series of debugging challenges in Scratch.

- **Debug** - Finding and fixing errors in code.
- **Conditional** - Asks a true/false (boolean) statement, and runs a chunk of code if the answer is true.

## 1. Engage/Explore/Explain: Debugging (20 min)
Participation: Independent, Online

- [ ] **Debugging:** Students login to Scratch and navigate to the debugging studio in “My Class”. For each challenge show students a gif of what the coder wanted the enemy to do. Coders will follow the 3 steps as they debug the code. Discuss solutions as a whole class before continuing to the next challenge. You can either show them the video solution or write the solution yourself in Scratch.

> > “Often when we are writing code it does not work the way we wanted it to. When this happens we need to debug. I have prepared 5 challenges for you to debug today. Let’s login to Scratch and follow the 3 steps to debug these: Compare, Find, Fix.”

- [ ] **Challenge 1**

<iconp type="question"> What does the coder want their program to do? What does it do instead?</iconp>
<iconp type="answer"> It moves forward and then moves backwards very slowly.</iconp>
<iconp type="question"> Ask students to find & fix the bug in their Scratch editor. </iconp>

	Solution: Add a wait 1 second block after each move block.

<br/>

- [ ] **Challenge 2**

<iconp type="question"> What does the coder want their program to do? What does it do instead?</iconp>
<iconp type="answer"> Instead of growing and shrinking, the enemy only grows.</iconp>
<iconp type="question"> Ask students to find & fix the bug in their Scratch editor. </iconp>

	Solution: Change the argument in the second “change size” block to a negative number and add wait blocks.

<br/>

- [ ] **Challenge 3**

<iconp type="question"> What does the coder want their program to do? What does it do instead?</iconp>
<iconp type="answer"> Instead of showing and hiding, it looks like the enemy doesn't do anything.</iconp>
<iconp type="question"> Ask students to find & fix the bug in their Scratch editor. </iconp>

	Solution: Add wait blocks between the show and hide.

<br/>

- [ ] **Challenge 4**

<iconp type="question"> What does the coder want their program to do? What does it do instead?</iconp>
<iconp type="answer"> Instead of changing color repeatedly, it changes color ten times and stops.</iconp>
<iconp type="question"> Ask students to find & fix the bug in their Scratch editor. </iconp>

	Solution: Change the repeat loop to a forever loop.

<note>![Challenge4](./images/slides-d4.png)</note>
<br/>

- [ ] **Challenge 5**

<iconp type="question"> What does the coder want their program to do? What does it do instead?</iconp>
<iconp type="answer"> Instead of zigzagging, it glides between 2 points.</iconp>
<iconp type="question"> Ask students to find & fix the bug in their Scratch editor. </iconp>

	Solution: Add more glide blocks and adjust the arguments.

<note>![Challenge5](./images/slides-d5.png)</note>

- [ ] **Explain:** the debugging protocol.

> > “Those 3 steps are steps that as a coder you should follow anytime your code isn’t doing what you wanted it to do:
> > 1. Compare: What do you want your program to do? What is it doing instead?
> > 2. Find: Where is the bug?
> > 3. Fix

## 2. Evaluate: Socrative (15 min)
Participation: Independent Online

- [ ] **Exit Challenge:** Students navigate to Socrative and answer the questions on SOC-26868660
