<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students learn to read code with loops by stepping through one block at a time. Using pre-written code, students guide a PixelBot's movements as it paints a grid.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can step through and act out code that contains a loop.
- I can predict the effects of code that contains a loop.

## 1. Engage: Observe & Unpack (8 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** challenge 1 in the practice playlist.
>> "Coders, today we are going to start with a new type of challenge. I want you to take the next 20 seconds to observe the challenge on the board. After the 20 seconds are up, I want you to raise your hand to share out anything you notice about it."

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge as a class by asking the questions below.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about this challenge?**</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What do you notice about the code?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What code blocks do you notice?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Where is the PixelBot located on the grid?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Are there any new buttons you notice?</iconp>

<note type='tip'>Asking students what they notice about the challenge allows teachers to tap into a studentâ€™s previous knowledge and to help guide students in making relevant observations. This question is purposefully repeated in numerous getCoding lessons as students become more familiar with observing, reflecting, and sharing their ideas.

By the end of this activity, students should be away of:
  - the types of blocks found in the code
  - the amount of code in the editor
  - the location and orientation of the PixelBot</note>

## 2. Explore: Try It Out (7 min)
- [ ] **Explain** that the loop block repeats the code nested inside.
>>"This new block repeats the code inside of it by the number you see next to it. This means that the code inside of this block will repeat 2 times. If I were to step through this code to act it out, I would step through it once and then go back to the top and do it all over again because the block says to that it should be acted out 2 times."

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to step through the code using the new controls under the grid.
>>"In this challenge we are going to use the new controls under the grid to step through the code like we did with Rover a few lessons ago. We can use the purple buttons to the move our PixelBot. When the code says to paint we can paint by clicking the green paint bucket below the grid. Remember that this code should be stepped through 2 times. Let's give it a try to see what the PixelBot paints!"

## 3. Explain: Loops (15 min)
- [ ] **Share Out:** Have student volunteers share out what they found the PixelBot painted.
<iconp type='question'>What did the PixelBot paint?</iconp>


- [ ] **Model** stepping through the code.

- [ ] **Think, Pair, Share:** Have students discuss the question below.
<iconp type='question'>Why do you think this type of code is useful?</iconp>


- [ ] **Explain** that the new code block is called a loop and demonstrate why it is useful.
>>"The new code block we discovered today is called a loop. Loop blocks help us code because they allow us to repeat code without having to write things over and over again. For example, if I wanted my PixelBot to move 9 times I would have to write 9 lines of code. With the loop block I can simply put a loop block around a move block and tell it to repeat 9 times. This shortens my code to 3 lines!"

- [ ] **Unpack** challenge 2 in the practice playlist as a class.
<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about this challenge?**</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What do you notice about the code?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What code blocks do you notice?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Where is the PixelBot located on the grid?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Are there any new buttons you notice?</iconp>

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to step through the code to see what it paints.

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have student volunteers share out what they found the PixelBot painted.
<iconp type='question'>What did the PixelBot paint?</iconp>

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBot Practice (20 min)

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to complete the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class to for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Extension:** If students finish early, have them work on the bonus playlist.

- [ ] **Review** challenges 3 and 5 as a class.

## 5. Evaluate: Exit Challenge & Debrief (10 min)
- [ ] **Exit Challenge:** Have students complete the 2 challenges in the exit playlist.

- [ ] **Debrief** the lesson as a class.
<iconp type='question'>**What was challenging about reading code with loops?**</iconp>
