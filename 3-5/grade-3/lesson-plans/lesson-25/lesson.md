## 1. Engage: Bug Tickets (5 min)
Participation: Whole Class, Unplugged

- [ ] **Bug Ticket:** Students complete their own bug ticket today if they are stuck. Introduce and read the Bug Ticket together.

> > “Today you are going to work on your projects on Scratch. As Coders we run into bugs. As coders we love the challenge of debugging our code! But sometimes we need help. Today if you need help debugging, fill out a Bug Ticket and then ask the class for help. Let’s look at a Bug Ticket together.”

## 2. Elaborate: Project Time (40 min)
Participation: Independent, Online

- [ ] **Work time:** Students have the rest of the lesson to work on their final project. Students should use a bug ticket today if they are stuck on a bug in their game and want to get help from the class. Have the student fill out the bug ticket and then get the whole class’s attention before having the student present their bug to the class. Students can also reference the coding zine if they need help.

> > “Continue to use your game plan to work on your Escape the Maze project. If you get stuck today, you are going to fill out a bug ticket to get help from your fellow coders.”
