Students practice writing code with conditionals, first unplugged by choreographing a dance, then on PixelBots.

- **Boolean:** A statement that can be “true” or “false”.
- **Conditional:** Asks a boolean statement, and runs a chunk of code if the answer is true.

## 1. Engage: Dance Dance Conditional (5 min)
- [ ] **Review** the steps of reading conditionals by calling a volunteer up to the front to perform the dance code on the board.

## 2. Explore: Paint the Square (10 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** the challenge.
>>“The square on the top left corner of the grid is a mystery color. It may be green or blue. If the square is green the pixelBot has to paint it yellow. If it is blue then it has to stay blue.”

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge as a class.
<iconp type='question'>How is this challenge different from the ones we normally solve?</iconp>

- [ ] **List** student responses on the whiteboard.
- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Provide students with think time and have them discuss with a partner.

<iconp type='question'>What would you try in order to solve this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Is there anything that you would need to be able to tell the computer?</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Students share their ideas with the class.

## 3. Explain: pixelBots (10 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** the pixelBot conditional.
>> “To solve the challenge from the explore activity we need to use a conditional. This is what conditional looks like in pixelBots.”

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have students examine the picture of the pixelBot conditional and respond to the questions below.

<iconp type='question'>What is the boolean statement in this conditional?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>The color is blue.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is missing in this conditional block?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>The word Then</iconp>

- [ ] **Explain** how a pixelBot conditional challenge works using challenge number 1 in the playlist titled “getCoding 3.14”. This is the same challenge from the explore activity.
>>“Notice the challengeBot that paints the grid we have to solve. In order to solve this challenge we have to read the directions. The directions say that if the challengeBot paints the square green I have to paint it yellow and if the square is blue it has to stay blue. My solution has to solve for both cases because sometimes the challengeBot will paint the square green and sometimes it will paint it blue.”

- [ ] **Code Along:** Play the code along video to show students how to solve challenge number 1 with the writing protocol. Have students code while following the steps in the video.

- [ ] **Model** how to complete a conditionals challenge by solving pixelBot challenge number 1.
>>“To write a solution for this challenge I will use the plan, code, validate protocol.”

## 4. Elaborate: pixelBots Challenges (15 min)
- [ ] **Guided Practice:** Have the class use the plan, code, validate protocol to solve challenge number 2.

<iconp type='question'>What do the directions say to do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Plan: What should we have our pixelBot do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Code: What should we code to make our pixelBot execute our plan?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Validate: What should we do to check if our code works?</iconp>

- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students solve a series of pixelBot challenges. During this time circulate to assist students in need of additional help.
>>“Alright coders, now it’s your turn. Continue to solve the rest of the pixelBot challenges using conditionals.”

- [ ] **Review** challenge numbers 3 and 8 as a class.

## 5. Evaluate: Exit Challenge (5 min)
- [ ] **Exit Challenge:** Students complete the exit challenge independently.
