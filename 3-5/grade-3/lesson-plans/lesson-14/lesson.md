<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 3.14, students learn how to write a program with an “IF” conditional statement. Students will discuss how an “if-then statement” will execute code, and how to use the switch block to switch colors.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can write a program with a conditional to solve a challenge.

## 1. Engage: Lights On (10 mins)
- **Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge One.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
<br/>
<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about the blocks?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>There is a switch block.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about the squares on the grid?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>There is a square with two colors.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about our goal?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>It shows a yellow square in the middle.</iconp>

<br/>

- [ ] **Introduce** the Switch Block and the random square.

<iconp type='question'>Do you notice a new block?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Students notice that there is a new block under the “Paint” category.</iconp>
<br/>
>>“This new block is called the Switch block! It works like a light switch. Let’s find out how. Imagine that this switch block controls whether a light is on or off. When you say “Switch!” the light bulb will turn on if it’s off, and turn off if it’s on.”

<br/>
>>“Here are the instructions for Challenge One today. It says: ‘Turn the random square on’ much like our light bulb scenario. This is called a random square. It will randomly select one of two colors you see now, yellow for ‘on’ and blue for ‘off.’ We can use code to tell the PixelBot if it should switch the color of the random square.”

<br/>

<iconp type='question'>Do we want the random square to be off or on for this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We want it to be on.</iconp>

<note type='tip'>
Demonstrate how you would place the Switch block inside the “IF” conditional block.
</note>

## 2. Explore: Try It Out (5 mins)
- **Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Challenge** students to discover how to use the “IF” conditional block and the switch block by writing code independently.
>>“We want our finished challenge to have a yellow block in the middle. I challenge you to use the ‘IF’ conditional block and the switch block to make sure that each time we run our code, our block will be ON.""

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students work independently to write code using the “IF” conditional block and the switch block.

<note type='tip'>
Allow students to try and struggle.
</note>

## 3. Explain: Writing Conditionals (10 mins)
- **Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Model** solving Challenge 1 or play the Code Along video.

- [ ] **Explain** how to write an “IF” conditional that turns the random square ON.

- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge 2.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
<br/>
<iconp type='question'>Which color means ‘on,’ and which color means ‘off’?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Yellow is on, blue is off.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about our goal?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>It shows a blue square and a yellow square.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Is the first square on or off? What about the second?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>The first square is off, and the second square is on.</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Model** solving Challenge 2.
>>“First, I notice that one of my blocks needs to be blue, or ‘off,’ and another block needs to be yellow, or ‘on.’ I know that my PixelBot needs to be standing on the square to paint it, so I move my PixelBot one step forward. I can now set a conditional to always have it painted blue. I click on the IF block and place a switch block inside of it. I set the condition of my IF block to IF ‘yellow’ because whenever it is yellow, I want it to change to blue. If it is blue already, it doesn’t need to change. Then I move two steps forward and create an IF conditional so that IF my block is blue, then it will always be switched to yellow.”

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBots Practice (15 mins)
- **Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students work independently to solve the rest of the challenges in the playlist.
<note type='tip'>
Consider pulling small groups for coders who need extra support.
<br/>
When facilitating debugging:
1. Allow coders to find the bug themselves.
2. Only the coders control the mouse.
3. Teacher models debugging process and asks coders questions to find the solution together.
4. Coders know that it's okay if they don't know the bug or how to solve it!
</note>

## 5. Evaluate: Reflection (15 mins)
- [ ] **Share Out:** Have 1-2 students share out their solutions for Challenge 5 and/or 6. Use the PixelBot teacher platform to display a student’s code on the projector.

<iconp type='question'>Explain how you solved the challenge.</iconp>
<br/>
- [ ] **Reflect** on the question below as a whole group.

<iconp type='question'>How did you feel about coding class today?</iconp>
<br/>
- [ ] **Think-Pair-Share:** Have student reflect with a partner and then share out.

<iconp type='question'>When does the code inside of a conditional run?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>When does the code inside of a conditional not run?</iconp>
