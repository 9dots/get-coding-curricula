<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 6, students begin working towards writing code containing loops by learning to identify patterns in the actions their PixelBot should execute. The actions they identify are then translated into code.

- **Code:** A set of instructions designed to be carried out by a computer.
- **Sequence:** A set of actions that must be performed in the order they are written.
</note>

## 1. Engage: Observe & Unpack (8 min)
- [ ] **Introduce:** challenge 1 in the practice playlist.
>>"Today, we are going to start with a PixelBot coding challenge. Take the next 20 seconds to observe the challenge on the board."

- [ ] **Unpack** challenge number 1 as a class.
<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about this challenge?**</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the goal of the challenge?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Where is the PixelBot on the grid?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What code blocks are available for us to use?</iconp>

## 2. Explore: Try It Out (7 min)
- [ ] **Challenge** the class to code a solution to the challenge.

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students attempt to debug the code on their own.

- [ ] **Monitor** students as they work. Look for students who can be called on to share their code. Priority should be placed on finding a student who codes a solution containing a pattern.

<note type='tip'>If no students code a solution containing a pattern, the Explain phase of the lesson contains an opportunity to model a solution containing a pattern.</note>

## 3. Explain: Patterns in Code (15 min)
- [ ] **Share Out:** Have student volunteers share out their solutions with the class. As students share their solutions display their code on the board by accessing it through the PixelBot teacher interface.

- [ ] **Explain** that some challenges can be solved by identifying patterns in the actions the PixelBot should perform and then translating the actions into code.
>>"Some coding challenges can be solved by coding patterns. This can be helpful when we code because we can simply repeat the code each time we want the PixelBot's actions to repeat."

- [ ] **Model** solving challenge by identifying a pattern in the actions the PixelBot should perform and then coding the solution.

- [ ] **Unpack** challenge number 2 as a class.
<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about this challenge?**</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the goal of the challenge?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Where is the PixelBot on the grid?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What code blocks are available for us to use?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What pattern do you see in the target grid?</iconp>

- [ ] **Think-Pair-Share:** Have students discuss and share potential patterns in the actions the PixelBot can perform to solve the challenge.

<iconp type='question'>What pattern can the PixelBot perform to solve the challenge?</iconp>

- [ ] **Model** solving the challenge by writing a pattern in the code.

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBot Practice (20 min)
<note type='tip'>Consider pulling a small group of students who need extra support for small group instruction. Use this time to provide extra guidance and solidify understanding.</note>

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to complete the PixelBot playlist by coding patterns.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Extension:** If students finish early, have them work on the bonus playlist.

<note type='tip'>Check challenges 3 and 4 in the practice playlist to track student progress.</note>

## 5. Evaluate: Reflect (10 min)
- [ ] **Discuss** the questions below as a class.
<iconp type='question'>How do you feel about what you learned today?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What was the most challenging part about finding patterns to code?</iconp>
