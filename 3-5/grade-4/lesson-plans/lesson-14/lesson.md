<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In this lesson, students will learn one part of writing code with functions: defining a function. To define a function, students will write the code that will execute when a function is called. For example, if the function is ‘square’, students will determine what code is necessary to make the PixelBot paint a square. They will be given challenges with starter code and must fill in the function’s missing code to complete the program. As a reminder on how functions work, you can review the [Code Along Video][video] from lesson 4.13.

## 1. Engage: Unpack (5 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** today's lesson.
>>“Coders, as we have learned, computers are not like humans. They ONLY know the directions we tell them. And we have learned that it is so important to be very clear when programming computers, so that they do exactly what we want. Last week we read code with functions. Today we are going to start writing code with functions. But before our PixelBots can perform a function, we need to make sure that they know exactly what those functions mean. So today, I am going to teach you how to define a function.”

- [ ] **Introduce** the first challenge of the day.
>>“Our first challenge of the day is on the board. Take the next 20 seconds to to observe the grid, the PixelBot, and the code.”

- [ ] **Unpack:** Challenge One as a class. Use the blank slide following the challenge to write down student observations.
<iconp type='question'>What do you notice?</iconp>
<br/>
Follow up questions
<iconp type='question'>What is the goal?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What function do you see?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do you think the function will do?</iconp>
<br/>
- [ ] **Run the code** for students to observe that something is missing. Elicit responses to the question below.

<iconp type='question'>What happened?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>The PixelBot was supposed to paint black squares to reach the goal, but it did not paint at all. If you look in the code, the function ‘square’ is called twice, but there is no code written in the definition of ‘square’, so nothing happens when we call it. </iconp>
<br/>
>>“If I had a pet PixelBot and I told her ‘paint a square’, she would look at me confused. Why would she be confused? (student response) Oh, so you’re saying she doesn’t understand the word ‘square’ and we have to define it for her? What commands DOES PixelBot understand? How can we use those commands to define the word square?”

<note type='tip'>
After the initial unpacking, run the code for students to see that something is missing. When asking students, ‘what happened?’ they should identify that:
- The PixelBot did not paint at all.
- The PixelBot only moved forward.
- There is missing code. When the function ‘square’ is called, nothing happens because there is no code  written for that function.
</note>
<br/>
## 2. Explore: Write the Code (15 mins)

- [ ] **Whole Class Exploration:**  As students share out suggestions for the code for the ‘square’ function, code their suggestions in PixelBots on the board as a visual aid. Continue to play the code they create until they get to one possible solution.
<iconp type='question'> How can we write the code for the function ‘square’?</iconp>

<note type='tip'>

Potential student misunderstanding: Students may have trouble understanding that the code in the function should make the PixelBot end in a position that the function can be called on again. You can:
- Have students step through the code until they get to the first function in the code. Then have them write code for the ‘square’ based on where the PixelBot is currently standing.
- Ask students, “How can we write the code for a ‘square’ so that the PixelBot is facing the same way in the end as when it started?”

## 3. Explain: Define the Function (10 mins)
- [ ] **Reinforce** vocabulary and name the skill that students just learned.
>>“Last week we learned that a function is a piece of code that you can call over and over again. When you call a function, you are telling your PixelBot to perform whatever code you have written for that function. In Challenge One, we had a ‘square’ function, but when we called the ‘square’ function nothing happened. The code was missing. We completed the program by writing the code for ‘square’. We call this “defining a function”.

- [ ]**Unpack** Challenge Two as a whole class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice?</iconp>
<br/>
Follow up questions:
<iconp type='question'>What is the goal?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What function do you see?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do you think the function will do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What might the function ‘line’ look like?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students define the function ‘line’ by writing the code to complete the challenge.

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have a student share out their solution for Challenge Two.

<iconp type='question'>What code did you use to define the function?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'> How did you decide what code you were going to use?</iconp>

<note type='tip'>
The purpose of the question, “How did you decide what code you were going to use?” is to guide students to begin using evidence to explain their choice of code. A sample response is as follows:
“I noticed that the PixelBot needed to paint three black lines, so each of these lines represented the function ‘line’. Then I noticed a pattern for each line: paint, step. So I decided to use a loop and have it paint, step 3 times because there are 3 black squares in each line.”

## 3. Elaborate: Pixelbots (15 mins)

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.
- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.


## 4. Evaluate: Reflection (15 mins)
- [ ] **Think-Write-Pair-Share:** Students reflect in their journals. Then they share with their partners before sharing out whole group.
<iconp type='question'>What steps did you take today to define a function?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How did you feel when you were coding today? Why?</iconp>
