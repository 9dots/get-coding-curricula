<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In this lesson, students start by making predictions about a sequence of code with an unfamiliar block: a function block. A function is a piece of code that you can call over and over again. It is a named section of a program that performs a specific task. In this sense, it is a type of procedure or routine. After discovering how a function works, students will unpack multiple challenges and practice reading code that contains a function.

## 1. Engage:What is a Function? (8 min)
- [ ] **Making Predictions** Show students Challenge One. Have them make predictions about what the code will do. Document their predictions on the blank slide with their names.

<iconp type='question'>What do you think this code will do?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Model** how to read code that contains a function by playing the code along video.
>>“This code contains a function. A function is a piece of code that you can call over and over again. When a function is called in a sequence of code, we jump out of the sequence and go down to the function definition. Then we go back up to where we left off and continue reading the code.”

- [ ] **Revising predictions:** Have students share out how their thinking has changed now that they’ve seen the code run.
<iconp type='question'>What did you notice?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Why do you think it did that?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Why do you think functions are useful?</iconp>

## 2. Explore/Explain: Reading Code (17 mins)

- [ ] **Unpack:** Challenge Two.
<iconp type='question'> What do you notice?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What function do you see?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many times is it called?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What will the function do?</iconp>

<br/>
- [ ] **Model** reading the code for Challenge Two in PixelBots. When you get to the second function in the sequence, ask students to tell you where to go to read the code for the function.

<iconp type='question'>This function is called ‘TwoFireDots’. Where do I go to read the code for this function?
</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge Three.
<iconp type='question'> What do you notice?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What function do you see?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many times is it called?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What will the function do?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Guided Practice:** Students share out suggestions for stepping through the code. As students tell you what to code on PixelBots, use the highlighter tool to keep track of their place in the sequence.
- [ ] **Share Out:** Students share out. Use the blank slide to document student responses.
<iconp type='question'>What did the PixelBot paint?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How was reading the code with a function different than code you’ve read in the past?</iconp>

## 3. Elaborate: Pixelbots (20 mins)

- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students complete a 4.13 practice playlist.
- [ ] **Extension:** Once students have passed Challenge Ten, they will automatically begin the bonus challenges.

## 4. Evaluate: Reflection (15 mins)
- [ ] **Think-Write-Pair-Share:** Students reflect in their journals. Then they share with their partners before sharing out whole group.
<iconp type='question'>How did you feel when you were coding today?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is a function?</iconp>
