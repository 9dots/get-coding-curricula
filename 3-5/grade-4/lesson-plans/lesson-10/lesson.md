<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
The purpose of this lesson is for students to use their new coding skills to create multiple solutions for one challenge. They will unpack a challenge and discuss their debugging plans before logging into PixelBots to attempt their code. After students write their code, they will have an opportunity to share and explain their solutions with the whole class. The class will then engage in discussion to compare the multiple solutions presented.

- **Loop:** A sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
- **Boolean:** A value that either can be “true” or “false”.
- **Conditional:** A boolean expression that determines which sequence of code to perform.

## 1. Engage: Unpack (6 mins)
- [ ] **Explain** the different structure of today’s lesson. Begin by using the slideshow to review some of the blocks and tools that students have learned to use so far.
>>“Today we are going to use everything we have learned so far and focus on just two different challenges. You are going to have an opportunity to solve challenge one in more than just one way and then we will share out the different solutions you came up with. Then we will do the same thing with a second challenge!”

<note type='tip'>As you review the blocks that students have learned so far, have students chorally respond the name for each block. Call on students to explain the purpose of specific blocks.

For example:
- When would we use a loop block?
- What is the yellow stepper tool used for?</note>

- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge One as a whole class.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice?**</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is the goal?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do we want the PixelBot to do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do you see any patterns?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Think-Pair-Share:** Have students think for 20 seconds and then turn to their partner to discuss the path they plan on coding for the PixelBot. Then share out whole group.

<iconp type='question'>**What is your plan?**</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>In what order do you want the PixelBot to paint the squares?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Why do you think it’s important to plan our code?</iconp>

<note type='tip'>As students share out their plans for writing the code, give them a sense of ownership by using the corresponding slide in the slideshow to type in their ideas along with their names.</note>

## 2. Explore: Multiple Solutions (12 mins)
- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students login to PixelBots and solve the first challenge two different ways. (They will complete Challenge One A and B).

- [ ] **Explain** where students will write their code, showing them the playlist as you explain.
>>“Okay coders, it’s time to login and write the code for Challenge One. Here is where this lesson starts to look a little different. You are going to have 10 minutes to solve the challenge two different ways. In the playlist, you will see Challenge 01a and Challenge 01b. First you will come up with one solution in a, and then you will go on to b and come up with another solution.”

<note type='tip'>As you look for different solutions around the class, it helps to do a little pre-work. Before the lesson, jot down as many solutions that you can come up with for Challenge One. Then look for students around the classroom that have used these solutions.
<br/>
Things to consider: Remember equity! What can you do to ensure all student voice is heard?</note>

- [ ] **Monitor** students as they work. Look for students who used different solutions and jot their names down, so you can display their code during the Explain section. Be sure to let those students know that they will be sharing their code. Use the Student Tracker provided to identify which students used which solution.

<note>As you identify potential students who can share their solutions, prepare them to share with the class by asking them questions to explain their code. The goal is to push students to explain their code beyond just rereading it to the class. Ex:
- Why did you use this block?
- How did you know to step three times?
- Why did you choose this path?</note>

## 3. Explain: Comparing Code (12 mins)
- [ ] **Model** what it looks like to explain your code. Do this by sharing one solution for Challenge One. Code your solution in PixelBots (ex. move 3 steps, paint, turn, move 3 steps, paint, turn, move 3 steps, paint, turn, move three steps, paint).
>>“I am going to show you how I want you to explain your code to the class. Let's look at my code on the board. I will say:
First, I know that I want my PixelBot to move in the shape of a square, so I need to figure out where to move first.
Then, I knew I needed 3 steps to get there because I counted. 1, 2, 3. Now that I'm here, I see I need to paint.
After that, I see that PixelBot needs to go this way, which means I need a turn block. And then I begin to count how many steps I need to get to the next painted square.
Finally, now that I'm done with my code, I can start to look for a pattern.
I remember that I have trouble with remember this turn block sometimes, but this time, I won't forget to add it as the core of this loop!”      

<note type='tip'>In the slideshow, sentence starters are displayed to help students explain their code. For example:

- I want my pixelbot to…
- I know I needed _ steps because…
- I used a turn block because…
- I noticed the pattern was...</note>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Display the various solutions that pre-selected students from the Explore section used. Have each student explain their code to the class.

<iconp type='question'>Explain your code. In what order did you want your PixelBot to paint the squares?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How did you code the path?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Think-Pair-Share:** Display three of the solutions in different windows, so students can see them side by side. Have students turn and talk to compare the various solutions.

<iconp type='question'>How are these solutions different?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How are they the same?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which solution would you choose? Why?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge Two as a whole class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is the goal?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do we want the PixelBot to do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do you see any patterns?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many times will you see the conditional?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Think-Pair-Share:** Have students think for 20 seconds and then turn to their partner to discuss the path they plan on coding for the PixelBot. Then share out whole group.

<iconp type='question'>What is your plan?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>In what order do you want the PixelBot to paint the squares?</iconp>

## 4. Elaborate: Write the Code! Round II (15 mins)
- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students login to PixelBots and solve Challenge Two in three different ways. (They will complete Challenge Two, A, B, and C).
>>“This time you are going to try and write the code for Challenge Two three different ways. You will have 15 minutes to do this. If you look at the playlist, you have space to do this in Challenge Two A, B, and C.”

- [ ] **Monitor** students as they work. Look for students who used different solutions and jot their names down, so you can display their code during the follow up discussion.

## 5. Evaluate: Wrapping Up (15 mins)
- [ ] **Share Out:** Display the various solutions that pre-selected students from the Explore section used. Have each student explain their code to the class.

<iconp type='question'>Explain your code. Why did you choose to use those blocks?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How did you code the path?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Discuss:** Display the solutions in different windows, so students can see them all. Have students engage in discussion to compare the various solutions just as they did with Challenge One.

<iconp type='question'>How are these solutions different?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How are they the same?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which solution would you choose? Why?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Think-Write-Pair-Share:** Students reflect in their journals. Then they share with their partners before sharing out whole group.

<iconp type='question'>What did you learn today?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How did you feel when you were coding? Why?</iconp>
