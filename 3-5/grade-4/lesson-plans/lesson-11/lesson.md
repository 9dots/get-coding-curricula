<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In this lesson, students will be reviewing the objectives learned in lessons 1-10. The purpose of this lesson is to help students prepare for their Independent Coding Challenge in Lesson 4.12. This lesson is set up as a cumulative review of all the objectives taught so far. The lesson is set up primarily as independent coding time with the option of pulling out pre-identified small groups for closer teacher attention. During the independent coding time, teachers can stop the class to debrief certain challenges that students are struggling with. Use the teacher interface to track student progress.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>

## 1. Engage: Review (1 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** today’s lesson to the class.
>>“Today is a special day. We’re going to see how much you’ve grown as coders. So far, you learned how to read, write, debug, and talk about your code. Today, you will strengthen those coding superpowers by practicing all your new skills. Next week, you will get to use those superpowers to do an Independent Coding Challenge!”

## 2. PixelBots Playlist (44 mins)

- [ ] **Explain** how to identify the type of challenge in the playlist. Use the corresponding slide to show students where they can look to identify if it is a read, write, or debug challenge.

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students login to PixelBots and begin the 4.11 practice playlist.

- [ ] **Target** students who need teacher support by pulling small groups based on PixelBot School data.

- [ ] **Review** two challenges with students after they have worked through about 2-3 challenges independently. Select challenges for review based on your class’ specific needs. Use the questions below to guide the discussion. See below for challenge numbers.  

<note type='tip'>You can use the teacher interface to create small groups by:
- identifying students that are stuck on the same challenge.
- identifying groups of students who completed the challenge, but did not meet the target goal.
</note>

- [ ] **Challenge One & Two (writing loops):**
<iconp type='question'>Do you see a pattern? What is it?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Students explain what code blocks make up the core of the pattern.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What blocks will be helpful to write the code?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>A loop block.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What should go inside of the loop?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>The core of the pattern.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Why do you want to use a loop block?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>It shortens our code. Instead of writing the code repeatedly which would take a long time, we can take the core of the pattern and nest it inside of a loop.</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Challenge Three & Four (writing conditionals):**
<iconp type='question'>What is a conditional?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>A conditional runs a chunk of code if a boolean statement is true.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What does the switch block do?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>If the random square is off, it switches it on. If the random square is on, it switches it off.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is the goal for this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Students describe the goal based on what the PixelBot should paint.</iconp>
<br/>

<note type='tip'>
As you review specific challenges with students as a whole class, begin the conversation by asking the questions provided. Then have students share out how they read, wrote, or debugged that specific challenge. You can:
- code along as students share out
- display student code through the teacher interface as they explain it

After reviewing two challenges with the whole class, release them to continue working independently. If needed, pull the class back as a whole to review more challenges following the same protocol.
</note>

- [ ] **Challenge Five (writing sequences):**
<iconp type='question'>What do you want the PixelBot to paint? What path should it take to reach the goal?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Students describe how the PixelBot will paint the goal.</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Challenge Six, Seven, & Eight (debugging sequences/loops):**
<iconp type='question'>What types of bugs have we identified?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Missing code bug, extra code bug, repeat bug.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do you want the PixelBot to do? What does it do instead?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Will vary by challenge.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What tools can we use to find the bug?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We can use the yellow stepper tool. When we get to the line of code where the PixelBot does not do what we want it to, we can add or delete a line of code and play the code to see if it works.</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We can use the green play button to identify what the PixelBot is doing wrong (i.e. paints the wrong square, turns the wrong way) and then look for this error in the code.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Where do you think the bug is in the code? Why?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Will vary by challenge.</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Challenge Nine (reading sequences):**
<iconp type='question'>What mistakes might you make when reading a sequence?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Painting the wrong square, turning the wrong direction, moving the wrong number of steps.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What tools can we use to ensure that we are reading the code correctly?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We can click on each line of code to highlight it. This helps us keep track of where we are as we read through the sequence.</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Challenge Ten (reading loops):**
<iconp type='question'>How many times do we have to repeat this sequence of code?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What tools can we use to ensure that we are reading the code correctly?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We can click on each line of code to highlight it. This helps us keep track of where we are as we read through the sequence.</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Challenge Eleven (reading conditionals):**
<iconp type='question'>What does a conditional do?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>A conditional runs a chunk of code if a boolean statement is true.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What does the switch block do?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>If the random square is off, it switches it on. If the random square is on, it switches it off.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How do you know if you need to step through the code inside the conditional or skip it?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>You look at the square that the PixelBot is standing on. If it is true, then you execute the code inside. If it is not true, then you skip the code and move on to the next line in the sequence that is outside the conditional.</iconp>
<br/>

## 2. Evaluate: Reflection (15 mins)

- [ ] **Think-Write-Pair-Share:** Students reflect in their journals by using a hashtag and emoji. Then they share with their partners before sharing out whole group.

<iconp type='question'>How did you feel when you were coding today?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do you want to keep practicing?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do you feel confident doing?</iconp>
