<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In this lesson, students will practice writing code with loops. They will first unpack challenges by planning the path for their PixelBot before writing the code. They will also identify the patterns in code that can be written in a loop. They will end the lesson by reflecting on the usefulness of loops in a program.

## 1. Engage: Map It Out (8 min)
- [ ] **Make a Connection** to what students learned in the previous lesson.
>>“Coders, last week we discovered a new block in PixelBots: the loop block. You did some great work reading code with loops and I can’t wait to see what you can do this week now that you’ve made this new block discovery!”

## 2. Explore: Write The Code (7 min)
- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Unpack the first challenge with the class. Display challenge one on the slide show and have students discuss what they notice.
>>“Today, I need your help with a new challenge. Here it is. Take 20 seconds to look at the challenge and then discuss with your partner what you notice.”

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have students share out their responses with the class. As students share out the path for the PixelBot, use dry erase markers to map the path over the grid. Use arrows for steps and a dot to mark the squares where they should paint. (DO NOT ERASE the path, it will be used in the Explain section.)

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the goal?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What do we want the pixelbot to do?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What path should the pixelBot take?</iconp>

## 3. Explain: In The Loop (10 min)
- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students log in to PixelBots and write the code for Challenge 1.

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have student share code who did NOT use a loop. As they tell you their steps, code along in Challenge One on the projector.

- [ ] **Model:** Go back to the mapped path and model how to identify the pattern. Using the blank slide, your students will only be able to see the path that you have mapped out as a whole class in the Explore section without the background grid. Model how to identify and circle the pattern.
>>“We have seen one way to write the code for this challenge. There is also another way we can write the code. First, let’s go back to our map and find a pattern. If I remove the grid, I can notice where I have a repeating pattern and circle it. This pattern repeats two times.”

- [ ] **Share Out:** Then, using the same process, have student share code who DID use a loop. If no students used the loop block, then you can model how to write the code WITH a loop.
>>“Now I’m going to get to the same goal by using the block we discovered last week: the loop block. I’m going to use the loop block and inside I am going to put the part of the path that I notice is repeating. I notice that the pixelbot is stepping two times and painting. This is what I will put in my loop block. Now I am going to count how many times this happens. Two times, so I will change it to loop two times.”

- [ ] **Share Out:** Students discuss the following questions.

<iconp type='question'>Are both of these strategies correct? How do you know?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which one of these strategies would you use? Why?</iconp>

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBots (20 min)
- [ ] **Share Out:** Students unpack Challenge Two on worksheet. Model how to write on the worksheet under a document camera as students are doing it on their worksheets. Circle the pattern.
>>“Here is the next challenge. Look at Challenge 2 on this worksheet. Let’s discuss what you notice and map the path out just like we did for Challenge 1.”

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the goal?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What do we want the pixelbot to do?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What path should the pixelBot take?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Do you see a pattern that repeats?</iconp>

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to try to code a solution to the challenge independently.
>>“Now try to write the code for this challenge! I challenge you all to use the loop block this time.”

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have students share the code they wrote in PixelBots for Challenge 2. They may struggle to write the correct code (possible misconception: missing a turn block). If students are missing the turn block, debug as a whole class.

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Release students to finish Challenge Three and the rest of the playlist using the worksheet to map out their path for Challenges 3-5.
>>“As you continue to work today, you will first map the path out for the challenges on your worksheet, just like we did for Challenge 1 and 2. You will map the path and find the pattern for Challenges 3 through 5. Then you can continue the rest of the challenges. Keep this strategy in mind as you finish the other challenges.”

- [ ] **Extension:** If students finish 4.05 Practice playlist, they can work on 4.05 Bonus playlist.

## 5. Evaluate: Exit Ticket/Reflection (15 min)
- [ ] **Exit Ticket:** Students complete 4.05 Exit ticket.

- [ ] **Reflection:** After students finish exit ticket, they can logout of computers and complete the reflection question in their journals.

<iconp type='question'>What is a loop? Why might a loop be useful in a program?</iconp>
