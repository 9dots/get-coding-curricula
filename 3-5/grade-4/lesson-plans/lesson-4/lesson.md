<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In this lesson, students will be introduced to loops in PixelBots and will make connections to what they did last year in Scratch. They will familiarize themselves with the loop block by using it to create their own sequence of code in PixelBots, and by working together to solve “read” challenges.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
-  I can step through a program with a loop to determine what the program does.

- **Loop:** A sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.

## 1. Engage: Mystery Block (5 mins)
- [ ] **Make a connection** to the previous week’s lesson.
>>“Last week, we learned how to debug in PixelBots. Debugging is an important skill that you’ll need to use all the time as you continue on your coding journey. This week, we’re going to be learning about a new feature in PixelBots. Let’s take a look at the PixelBots interface.”

- [ ] **Reveal** the PixelBots interface.

<iconp type='question'>Do you notice any blocks on the screen that we haven’t used yet?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>The red block under “control,” and the gray block under “comment.”</iconp>

<iconp type='question'>What do you think this block does?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Answers may vary.</iconp>

## 2. Explore: PixelBots Exploration (10 mins)
- [ ] **Explain** that there are no right answers for this challenge; students will be creating their own programs using the new block.

- [ ] **Explain** what it means to create a program by showing students the GIF slide.
>>“Today you are going to start by creating your own program. You are going to write code to make your pixelbot paint whatever you want it to paint! For example, in this GIF, I created a program that made a light and dark pink box. Think about what you might want to create.”

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students login to Pixelbots and navigate to the blank challenge called “4.04 Explore.”
>>“Let’s login to PixelBots and see what we can do with this new block. For the next 10 minutes, as you write code for your program, utilize this new block. Your code should make the PixelBot paint something on the grid. As you’re coding, think about what this block does and how it might be useful.”

- [ ] **Monitor** students as they work, looking for one or two students who have used the loop block to successfully create a program. They will share in the Explain section.

## 3. Explain: “And the block is…” (15 mins)
- [ ] **Discuss** with students what they discovered while coding with this new block.

<iconp type='question'>Now that you’ve tried coding with this new block, what do you think it does?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>It repeats the code inside of it a certain number of times.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How do you know? Explain what you did and what you saw.</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Students’ answers will vary.</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Call on one or two selected students to share their programs. Open their code on your computer and project it on the whiteboard. Have volunteers explain how their program works.
>>“Does anyone want to show us what you created and how you used the new block to create it?”

- [ ] **Define** “loop” for the students, and explain the loop block’s function.
>>“The block that we’ve been using today is called a loop block. A loop is a sequence of instructions that is repeated a certain number of times, or until a certain condition is reached.”

- [ ] **Make a connection** to what students did last year in Scratch.

<iconp type='question'>Does the loop block remind you of any blocks you may have used last year in Scratch?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>The “repeat” and “forever” blocks.</iconp>

- [ ] **Check for understanding** by asking the question below.

<iconp type='question'>What does the loop block do in PixelBots?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>It repeats the sequence inside of it a certain number of times.</iconp>

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBots Challenges (20 mins)
- [ ] **Model** how to complete a “read” challenge with a loop by viewing the video as a class.

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students work independently to solve read challenges in the practice playlist. Each student uses a “Code Summaries” handout to write down summaries of what the code made the PixelBot do for the first five challenges.

- [ ] **Extension:** Early finishers can complete the 4.04 Bonus playlist.

## 5. Evaluate: Exit Challenge/Reflection (10 mins)
- [ ] **Exit Ticket:** Have students navigate to the 4.04 Exit Ticket and complete independently.

- [ ] **Reflection:** Once they have completed the exit ticket, they can logout of computers and complete the reflection question in their journals.

<iconp types='question'>What is a loop? Why might a loop be useful in a program?</iconp>
