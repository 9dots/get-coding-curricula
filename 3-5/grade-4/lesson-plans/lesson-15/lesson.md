<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In this lesson, students will continue to build on previous knowledge to write code with functions. In the previous lesson, students learned to define a function given starter code. In this lesson, they will use functions already provided to write code. By the end of this lesson, students should begin to discover the usefulness of writing code with functions.

- I can call on more than one function to solve a problem.

## 1. Engage: Step It Up (1 min)
- [ ] **Motivate** students for today’s lesson.
>>“Coders, last week you did an awesome job learning how to define functions! Today we are going to continue to write code with functions, but we are going to kick it up a notch. What do I mean by that? Let’s take a look at our first challenge..”
>

## 2. Explore: Make a Plan (9 mins)

- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge One.

<iconp type='question'> What do you notice?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is the goal?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do we want the PixelBot to do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do you see in the code already?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do you think the functions will do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How can we use the code provided to reach the goal?</iconp>

<note type='tip'>
When asking students, “How can we use the code provided to reach the goal?” you should guide students to discover that there are new functions available to use as they write their code.
</note>
<br/>

- [ ]**Model** how to call each function and play the code, so that students can see what each function does before planning their paths.
- [ ] **Plan** the path for Challenge One. Have students share out the paths they will code by using dry erase markers to map them out on the board.

<iconp type='question'>What path will you take to reach the goal?</iconp>

## 3. Explain: Calling Functions (15 mins)
- [ ] **Model** the solution for Challenge One by choosing one of the paths that a student drew and writing the code in PixelBots.

>>“I am going to use the functions that have already been defined here as I write my code. Since I have already called each function and played the code to see what they do, I can use my knowledge of what these functions do to help paint the goal.”

<note type='tip'>
As you model writing the code for Challenge One, it is important to inform students that:
They should not change the code in the function.
If they accidentally change code in the function, they can fix it by resetting the code. However, warn them that resetting here will also reset any other code they have already written.
</note>
<br/>

- [ ]**Unpack** Challenge Two.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is the goal?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do we want the PixelBot to do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do you see in the code already?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do you think the functions will do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How can we use the code provided to reach the goal?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Plan** the path for Challenge Two. Have students share out the paths they will code by using dry erase markers to map them out on the board.
<iconp type='question'>What path will you take to reach the goal?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:**  Students login to PixelBots playlist 4.15 to write the code for Challenge Two.

- [ ]**Share Out:** Have one or two students share the code they created for Challenge Two.

<iconp type='question'>What path did you take?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Why did you choose to use those blocks in your code?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ]**Think-Pair-Share:** Have students think and discuss the following question.
<iconp type='question'>How did the functions in Challenge Two make coding easier?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Why do we use functions?</iconp>

<note type='tip'>
As students discuss the purpose of using functions in PixelBots, guide them to identify that functions are useful because they:
Save time not having to write the code over and over again.
If you make a mistake you only have to change it in one place.
Make the program feel less complicated and more readable.
</note>
<br/>

## 3. Elaborate: Pixelbots (20 mins)

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work independently to complete playlist 4.15.
- [ ] **Review** At the end of independent practice time, select a challenge from the playlist to review with the whole class if they still need additional support to solidify today’s skill.

<note type='tip'>
Tips to help students as they write code with functions:
Encourage students to try the functions before they start writing code.
Have students plan a route before coding.
Have students identify parts of the goal that can be executed with one of the functions.
</note>
<br/>

## 4. Evaluate: Reflection (15 mins)
- [ ] **Think-Write-Pair-Share:** Students reflect in their journals. Then they share with their partners before sharing out whole group.
<iconp type='question'>Why are functions useful?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How did you feel when you were coding? Why?</iconp>
