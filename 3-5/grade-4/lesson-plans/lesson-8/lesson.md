<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In this lesson, students will be introduced to conditionals in PixelBots and will make connections to what they did last year in Scratch. They will familiarize themselves with the “if, then” block by exploring in PixelBots with this new block, and by working independently to solve “read” challenges.

**Boolean:** A value that either can be “true” or “false”.
**Conditional:** A boolean expression that determines which sequence of code to perform.

## 1. Engage: Mystery Block (5 mins)
- [ ] **Introduce** students to today’s lesson.
>>“This week, we’re going to be learning about a new block in PixelBots. Let’s take a look at PixelBots.”

- [ ] **Reveal** the PixelBots interface with Challenge 1.

<iconp type='question'>Do you notice any blocks in the code that we haven’t used yet?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>The block that says “IF”.</iconp>

>>“That’s right. There is a new block that we haven’t worked with yet. It is this ‘if’ block here.”

<iconp type='question'>What do you think this block does?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Answers may vary.</iconp>

- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge 1.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do you think this code will do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about the code blocks?</iconp>

## 2. Explore: Making Discoveries (5 mins)
- [ ] **Model:** Login to PixelBots 4.08 practice playlist to model how to read the code for Challenge 1.
>>“I notice the first line says ‘IF’ and then there is blue paint. This means, “If ‘pixelbot touching blue’ is true..” I notice it IS true. The pixelbot is standing on a blue square, so I need to read the code inside. If ‘pixelbot touching blue’ is true, then paint purple. I will paint purple. Now there is no more code to read so I am done and I can check it.”

## 3. Explain: Conditionals (15 mins)
- [ ] **Define** “conditional”  and “boolean” for the students. Ask students to define “boolean” before reviewing the definition from the previous year.

>>“The block that we just discovered is a conditional block. A conditional uses a boolean expression to determine which sequence of code to perform. Does anyone remember what a boolean expression is from last year? (elicit student response) That’s right! A boolean statement is a value that can either be “true” or “false”.

<note type='tip'>When solving Challenge 2, students are expected to struggle. The follow up conversation will clear up any misconceptions and help students to understand how the code is executed. After the discussion they should understand that:
- The pixelbot ONLY knows the color it is currently standing on.
- They should read the conditional based on whatever color the PixelBot is on.</note>

- [ ] **Make** a connection to what students learned in Scratch last year.

<iconp type='question'>Does this block remind you of any blocks you may have used last year in Scratch?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Ex. If touching blue, then move -10 steps.</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Ex. If touching enemy 3, then go to x: y:</iconp>

>>“Yes! This is just like the “If, then..” blocks you used in Scratch last year. In fact, we can call this new conditional block that we discovered today the same thing. We can call it the “If, then..” block. The “If, then..” block we just used in Challenge 1 would read like this: If pixelbot touching blue, then paint purple. Let’s all say that together.”

- [ ] **Choral** read the code for Challenge 1 as a whole class.

- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge 2.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do you think this code will do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about the code blocks?</iconp>

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students complete Challenge 2.

- [ ] **Share Out:** Students share out what they discovered about the code in this challenge. Pull out the difference between this Challenge and Challenge 1.

<iconp type='question'>Can you explain how this code works?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is the difference between this challenge and challenge 1?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Did you struggle to solve the challenge? What was going wrong?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How did you fix your mistake?</iconp>

- [ ] **Explain** that when reading conditionals in PixelBots you can put yourself in the shoes of the pixelbot when reading the code.
>>“Remember, computers are simple. They don’t think like us. The pixelbot mind is so simple that it only knows what color it’s standing on and nothing else. In challenge 2, it is standing on a yellow square. So let’s read the code together now to determine what the pixelbot will do.”

- [ ] **Choral** read the code for Challenge 2 as a whole class.
>>“If pixelbot touching blue is true, then paint purple. Is the pixelbot touching blue? (No.) Then do we paint purple? (No.) Great! There is no more code to read so we are finished.”

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBots (20 mins)
- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students work independently to solve the rest of the read challenges in the practice playlist.

- [ ] **Extension:** Early finishers can complete the 4.08 Bonus playlist.

## 5. Evaluate: Exit Ticket/Reflection (15 mins)
- [ ] **Exit Ticket:** Have students navigate to the 4.08 Exit Ticket and complete independently.

- [ ] **Reflection:** Once they have completed the exit ticket, they can logout of computers and complete the reflection question in their journals.

<iconp type='question'>What did you learn about conditionals today?</iconp>
