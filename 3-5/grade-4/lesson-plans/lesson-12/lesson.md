<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In this lesson, students will be independently completing a playlist based on the objectives learned in lessons 1-10. The purpose of this lesson is for students to show all they know on the skills taught so far. Before students begin the Independent Coding Challenge, they are reminded how to identify the specific type of challenge (read, write, or debug). The rest of the lesson is set up primarily as independent coding time. When students have completed the playlist, they will be able to go back and complete any bonus playlist from Lessons 1-11.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can write a program to solve a challenge.
- I can step through a program to determine what it does.
- I can identify and debug two different types of bugs.
- I can step through a loop to determine what a program does.
- I can write a program with loops to solve a challenge.
- I can identify and debug two different bug types in a looping sequence of code.
- I can step through a conditional to determine what a program does.
- I can write a program with a conditional to solve a challenge.
- I can write more than one solution to solve a challenge.

## 1. Engage: (5 min)
- [ ] **Motivate** students for today's challenge.
>>“Today is an exciting day! Last week you had a chance to strengthen all your coding superpowers. One thing I noticed is that so many more of you are using the stepper tool now to debug your code. That’s a great thing coders do to check their work! Today you get to use those super strong powers to complete an Independent Coding Challenge. Are you ready?”

- [ ] **Explain** how to identify each type of challenge in the playlist. Use the corresponding slide to show students where they can look to identify if it is a read, write, or debug challenge.

## 2. Independent Coding Challenge (35 mins)

- [ ] **Independent Work Time:** Students log in to PixelBots and complete the Independent Coding Challenge. Students should complete the playlist independently.


- [ ] **Extension**  If students complete the ICC, they can go back to work on any of the bonus playlists from Lesson 1-11.

<note type='tip'>Because the Independent Coding Challenge is a chance for students to show what they have learned, students should be working independently, with no support from teachers. If students struggle or ask for help, you can:
- encourage them to think of all the strategies they have learned so far (play the code, step through the code, plan the path, etc.).
- have them reference the anchor charts displayed in the classroom.

## 3. Survey: (20 mins)

- [ ] **Survey:** Students complete a survey using the link provided: [tinyurl.com/botsurvey1](http://tinyurl.com/botsurvey1)

>>“Boys and girls, you are no longer beginners! Today you showed so much of what you've already mastered this year in coding class. Let’s finish by answering some questions about how you feel as coders before we dive into the next level of coding next week.”
