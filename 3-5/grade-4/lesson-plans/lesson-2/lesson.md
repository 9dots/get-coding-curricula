<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In this lesson, students will practice following a sequence of instructions to complete a challenge. They will utilize tools, such as index cards, that help them step through code on paper and learn how to step through code on the PixelBots grid. They will solidify the skill of reading code by completing a PixelBots playlist. Then they will reflect on the process of making mistakes, how it makes them feel, and how they fix their mistakes.

## 1. Engage: Igloo Challenge (10 min)
-  [ ] **Motivate** students for today’s lesson by introducing them to the Igloo challenge.
>>“I have a challenge for you and your partner today. Your partner is sitting next to you. Our PixelBot, Penguin, lives in Antarctica and it’s very cold there and everything is snow and ice and just plain white. She wants to make her neighborhood a little more beautiful and add some life to it, so she came up with the wonderful idea to paint the igloos different colors!  She needs your help to step through her route to paint each house.”

- [ ] **Explain** and assign roles to each student.
>>“All students sitting on right raise your hand. You are the Bot. The Bot is responsible for moving Penguin around on the grid and painting the igloos with the correct color. Here are your materials (reference slideshow). Put them in front of you now.
All students sitting on the left raise your hand. You are the Coder. The Coder is responsible for stepping through the code and telling the Bot what to do. Here are your materials (reference slideshow). Put them in front of you now.”

## 2. Explore: Making Connections (5 min)
- [ ] **Pair Exploration:** Partner pairs attempt to complete the challenge.

- [ ] **Share Out:** After students have finished the Igloo challenge, have the class choral read the code as the Coder while the teacher acts as the Bot by using the animation on the slide show.

- [ ] **Review** what a sequence is by calling on students.
<iconp type='question'>What a sequence is?</iconp>

- [ ] **Define** what a sequence is.
>>"A sequence is a set of actions that must be performed in the order they are written."

## 3. Explain: PixelBots (10 min)
-  [ ] **Model** how to use PixelBots in a “Read” lesson by watching the video on the slideshow.

-  [ ] **Make a Connection** between how students used the penguin token in the challenge and how they will move the Penguin on the PixelBots platform.
>>“Let’s think about how reading code in our Igloo Challenge is like reading code in PixelBots. When we read our code in our Igloo Challenge, we moved penguin by picking her up and placing her on the grid. On PixelBots we can do the same thing by using the purple buttons to move our PixelBot. We ‘paint’ a square by first choosing a color and then clicking the paint button.”

## 4. Elaborate: Making Mistakes (20 min)
- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Show them how to log in to PixelBots by using the corresponding slides.
>>“Let’s log in so you can begin!”

- [ ] **Monitor** students as they complete the challenges.

- [ ] **Review** Challenge 3 with students as a whole group.

- [ ] **Discuss** how it sometimes takes us a few tries to get it right as coders. Have students discuss ways that they learned from their mistakes.

<iconp type='question'>Did you always get the challenge right the first time?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>No. I made mistakes.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What were some of the mistakes you made?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Possible answers: I put the PixelBot in the wrong location, I colored the grid the wrong color, I turned the wrong direction, I didn’t know how to use the button.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What steps did you take to fix your mistake?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Possible answers: I reset the PixelBot, I read the code from the beginning again, I used the cursor to keep track of where I was in the code.</iconp>

<iconp type='question'>(If students only talk about interface issues, then ask:) Did you make any mistakes in reading your code?</iconp>

## 5. Evaluate: Exit Challenge/Reflection (15 min)
- [ ] **Exit Challenge (7-10 mins):** Have students complete today’s exit challenge. When they finish, they can answer the reflection question in their journals.
>>“Great work today stepping through code carefully to avoid mistakes! Your last challenge for the day is to complete the exit challenge. Go ahead and get started. Once you’ve finished you can answer the reflection question in your journals.”

**Reflection Question (5-7 mins):**
<iconp type='question'>How did you feel about coding class today? Use one word to describe your feeling.</iconp>  
<iconp type='answer'>Think about a time you make a mistake while coding? How did you feel?</iconp>
