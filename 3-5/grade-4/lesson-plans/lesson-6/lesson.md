<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In this lesson, students will continue to build their code writing skills with more rigorous loop challenges. They will begin by identifying the pattern(s) repeated inside a loop block. In Lesson 4.05, student began learning how to read loops, in this lesson, students will begin mastering the skill of writing loops with tricky turns.

- **Loop:** A sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.

## 1. Engage: Unpack (4 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** today’s lesson and Challenge One by displaying it on the projector.
>>“Coders, today is our second class writing code with loops. You did some awesome work last week and now it’s time to level up. Today we are going to write code not only with loops, but also with some pretty tricky turns. Take the next 20-30 seconds to observe Challenge One.”

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge with the class.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice?**</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is the goal?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do we want the pixelbot to do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What path should the pixelbot take?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do you see any patterns the pixelbot would have to perform as it paints the image?</iconp>

## 2. Explore: In the Loop (8 min)
- [ ] **Guided Practice:** Have students suggest how to write the code for Challenge One with a loop. Code along on the projector in PixelBots as they share out.
>>“One thing you should always do when you are writing code with a loop is to look at the PixelBot’s orientation. ‘Orientation’ means the way the PixelBot is facing. We need to make sure that when we get to the code at the end of our loop, the PixelBot is in the right position to start the code from the beginning of the loop again. In this case, the PixelBot needs to start by moving forward two steps at the beginning of each loop. Now let’s see if there is any code we need to add to the end of the loop to make that happen.”

<note type='tip'>As students share out how to write the code, do not correct them if they leave out the final turn in the sequence. Play the code and let them discover the bug and how to fix it.</note>

## 3. Explain: Write the Code (13 min)
- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge Two.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice?**</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is the goal?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do we want the PixelBot to do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What path should the PixelBot take?</iconp>

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students log in to PixelBots and write the code for Challenge Two. The goal is for students to write the code with a loop.

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have students share their code as you display on the projector using the teacher PixelBots interface.

<iconp type='question'>**Did you come across any bugs as you wrote the code?**</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What was the bug?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How did you fix it?</iconp>

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBots (20 min)
- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students complete 4.06 practice playlist on PixelBots.

- [ ] **Extension:** If students complete practice playlist, they can move on to the 4.06 bonus playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** students by walking around the room and checking student progress on the teacher interface.

<note type='tip'>As you monitor student progress on the teacher interface, this is a good opportunity to pull a small group and/or do one-on-one check ins with students who may need additional support.

Use Challenge 3 and 4 as exit ticket data.</note>


## 5. Evaluate: Reflection (15 min)
- [ ] **Think-Write-Pair-Share:** Students reflect in their journals by using a hashtag and emoji. Then they share with their partners before sharing out whole group.
>>“Today you will answer the following question in your journals. Take a minute to think about it: ‘How did you feel when you were coding today?’ I want you to write your answer by using a hashtag, here are some examples of hashtags (show slide). You can also be creative and come up with your own! Then draw an emoji to show how you felt today. We will share out in a few minutes.”

<iconp type='question'>**What did you learn today? How did you feel when you were coding?**</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What parts were challenging?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What made it easy?</iconp>

<note type='tip'>Use the follow up questions in the whole group discussion to focus students on talking about their code and the process of coding.</note>
