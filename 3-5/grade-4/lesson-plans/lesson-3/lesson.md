<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In this lesson, students will become more proficient in debugging code. They will solve a challenge that requires them to identify different types of bugs and engage in a discussion about the different types of bugs with the class. They will continue practicing debugging code in PixelBots.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
-  I can identify and debug two different types of bugs.

## 1. Engage: Igloo Challenges (12 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** students to today’s challenge.
>>“Today I have a challenge for you. Another one of Penguin’s friends, Picasso, asked her to paint his igloo blue. Picasso gave Penguin directions to his igloo, but he made a mistake in his directions. If we don’t find his mistake and fix it, Penguin isn’t going to be able to get the job done.”

- [ ] **Explain:** Split students into partners and explain roles: Coder and Bot.
>>“You will work in pairs to find the bug. Just like in our last lesson, the Coder is responsible for stepping through the code and telling the Bot what to do. You will also annotate the code. Annotate means “to add notes”.”

- [ ] **Model** how to annotate the code using the corresponding slide.

- [ ] **Paired Exploration:** Students will work with their partners to solve one of two different challenges. Each challenge presents a different type of bug. Randomly assign challenges to each pair.

## 2. Explore: Bug Types (8 min)
- [ ] **Share Out:** Step through the debugging process for each challenge in the slideshow.
>>“Let’s look at the two challenges you completed today.”

- [ ]  **Explain:** After reviewing each challenge, explain the type of bug to students.
>>“In challenge 1, you discovered that you were missing a line of code. This is called a Missing Code bug.
In challenge 2, you discovered that the code had extra lines that you didn’t need. This is called an Unwanted Code bug.
Each of you has discovered a different type of bug!” (Define bug and debug.)

- [ ] **Make a Connection** to the Pixelbots activity that students will be working on today.
>>“Just like you found bugs in the Igloo challenge, there are different types of bugs in computer programming. You just stepped through code on paper to fix a bug. Now, we are going to step through code on PixelBots to debug.”

- [ ] **Model** how to debug code on the Pixelbot platform by playing the video and asking follow up questions.
>>“Before we can become bug catchers, we need to learn how to debug on Pixelbots. Let’s watch this video together.”

<iconp type='question'>How do we step through the code?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We can use the yellow stepper.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How do we change the amount of steps we want Pixelbot to make?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We can click on the number in the block and change it to the one we want.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How do we change the color we want Pixelbot to paint?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We can click on the color in the block and change it to the one we want.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What does “modification” mean in the editor?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Modification tells us how many changes we can make.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Why do we need to use the cursor (the white blinking bar)?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We use the cursor to click in between the blocks when we want to add an extra line of code.</iconp>

## 3. Explain: PixelBots (20 min)
- [ ] **Model** how to complete Challenge 1 by projecting PixelBots challenge on the projector and identify the type of bug on the Type of Bug worksheet. Use corresponding slides.

- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Have students login to Pixelbots and complete the playlist. Pass out the Type of Bug worksheet for them to keep track of the types of bugs for each challenge.
>>“Now that we have discovered two different types of bugs, it’s time for you to practice debugging on PixelBots! Today as you debug code, your goal is to find and fix the bugs without deleting the entire code and starting all over again. Look for the types of bugs we discovered today. You are responsible for identifying the types of bugs for EACH challenge. You will circle the correct bug on the worksheet. Don’t forget to look at the ‘Types of Bugs’ chart if you need a reminder of the three bugs we learned about today.”

- [ ] **Extension:** Early finishers can complete the 4.03 Bonus playlist.

## 4. Elaborate: Fixing Bugs (5 min)
- [ ] **Review:** Have students discuss ways that they fixed each type of bug. Display the GIFS for how to fix each type of bug.

<iconp type='question'>What did you do when you came across a Missing Code bug? How did you fix it?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Possible answer: I thought about what I wanted to happen and what action was missing. I used the cursor to click where I wanted to add a block and I tested it.</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What did you do when you came across an Unwanted code bug? How did you fix it?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Possible answer: I stepped through the code to find the line of code that I didn’t need. Then I deleted it.</iconp>

## 5. Evaluate:
- [ ] **Exit Ticket:** Have students navigate to the 4.03 Exit Ticket and complete independently.

- [ ] **Reflection:** Once they have completed the exit ticket, they can logout of computers and complete the reflection question in their journals.

<iconp type='question'>What is a bug? How did you feel when you encountered a bug?</iconp>
