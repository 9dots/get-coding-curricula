## Purpose
1. Empower students to use computational thinking practices to analyze problems, build solutions, and be creative.
2. Empower teachers to teach coding / best practices in computational thinking instruction.
3. Empowering students to share code to communicate their thinking , open their thinking up to critique, and revise their thinking.

## Big Goals
1. Students will identify as coders.
1. Students will experience bugs as learning opportunities.
1. Students will be fluent in reading, writing, and debugging code.
1. Students will share their thought process around coding, and respond to each otherâ€™s thoughts.

## Understandings
- Coders fearlessly take on challenges and view bugs as opportunities for reflection and learning.
- Engaging in discussion and reflection around their process helps them solve more complex problems.
- Challenging problems have many solutions, and discussion helps us identify the best solution.
- Functions make programs more powerful and readable.

## Essential Questions
1. What defines a good program?
1. When presented with multiple programs, how do I decide which program is the best one to meet my goal?
1. Why would I use a function in my program?
1. How can collaborating with other coders help you to write better programs?
1. What is my process for fixing bugs, and what tools can I use to help me fix them?

| Title             | Description        | Objectives |Practice|
| ------------------|--------------------| -----------|--------|
| [Lesson 01: Writing Sequences](../grade-4/lesson-plans/lesson-1/lesson.html)| In lesson 1 students are introduced to the program, PixelBots. They explore how the program works and what tools are available as they practice writing sequences. They will also engage in discussion to identify what they have discovered on PixelBots.| I can step through a program to determine what it does.|Writing |
