|[Lesson 12: Independent Coding Challenge I](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r8ykMrU5VHgluKVurV6N3pae6YVPi-SKHKTBQeu6D3I)|In this lesson, students will be independently completing a playlist based on the objectives learned in lessons 1-10. The purpose of this lesson is for students to show all they know on the skills taught so far. Before students begin the Independent Coding Challenge, they are reminded how to identify the specific type of challenge (read, write, or debug). The rest of the lesson is set up primarily as independent coding time. When students have completed the playlist, they will be able to go back and complete any bonus playlist from lessons 1-11.|All objectives from lessons 1-10.|
|[Lesson 13: Discovering Functions](https://drive.google.com/open?id=191n3b7lpTkl9n_ZaXzMUX_7VwBaa6vTOEKygdTqtGV4)|In this lesson, students start by making predictions about a sequence of code with an unfamiliar block: a function block. A function is a piece of code that you can call over and over again. It is a named section of a program that performs a specific task. In this sense, it is a type of procedure or routine. After discovering how a function works, students will unpack multiple challenges and practice reading code that contains a function.|I can step through code containing a function.|
|[Lesson 14: Defining Functions](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1f3kiFMY9WQ75FG23fw3c6Yzuy0DOoCVP72OujPr_jy8)|In this lesson, students will learn one part of writing code with functions: defining a function. To define a function, students will write the code that will execute when a function is called. For example, if the function is ‘square’, students will determine what code is necessary to make the PixelBot paint a square. They will be given challenges with starter code and must fill in the function’s missing code to complete the program. As a reminder on how functions work, you can review the code along video from lesson 13.|I can define a function to complete a program.|
|[Lesson 15: Calling Functions](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ytEtf1uHWMDnUI7g2j1iUzNroGIrDPJIMEheozkG2eU)|In this lesson, students will continue to build on previous knowledge to write code with functions. In the previous lesson, students learned to define a function given starter code. In this lesson, they will use functions already provided to write code. By the end of this lesson, students should begin to discover the usefulness of writing code with functions.|I can call on more than one function to solve a problem.|
|[Lesson 16: Writing with Functions](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cSv89_sZHsCbiOBW5JA7P5VaiH-LsjaXKU7q1gRM9cA)|In this lesson, students will decompose images in PixelBots in order to find opportunities to write functions.
