<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
 Students practice reading code written with conditionals that instructs them in drawing a robot. They then Code Along to write conditionals in Scratch that allow their Sprites to interact with each other.

- I can read an if-then statement to execute a sequence if a test is true.

- **Boolean:** A statement that can be "true" or "false".
- **Conditional** Asks a boolean statement, and runs a chunk of code if the answer is true.

## 1. Kids Code (5 min)
Participation: Whole Class Unplugged

- [ ] **Showcase** the video of Anivitha, the youngest programmer to attend Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference last year, and challenge students to be the next programmer we feature.

> > “Kids all around are coding and creating. If you code a project on your own, we would like to feature your project/app at the start of our class. Code something in Scratch or Code.org or any coding platform and show it to your getCoding teacher.”

- [ ] **Motivate** students by connecting today’s lesson on reading conditionals to their Escape the Maze games.

<iconp type="question"> When you played the 3 versions of Escape the Maze, what happened when the hero touched an enemy?</iconp>
<iconp type="answer">It went back to the start.</iconp>
> > “This is an example of code that uses a conditional! Today you are going to read the code that caused the hero to react to touching the enemies.”

## 2. Explore: Build-a-Bot (15 min)
Participation: Independent Unplugged

- [ ] **Connect Prior Knowledge:** Remind students what a conditional is and of the tools we use to read code.

<iconp type="question"> The code on the side of your paper are your instructions for building your robot. What are we going to use our index cards for?</iconp>
<iconp type="answer">Uncover each line of code one at a time as we read.</iconp>
<iconp type="question"> Look at the yellow blocks of code on your paper that start with “If”. What do we call code that starts with “If”?</iconp>
<iconp type="answer">Conditionals. Bonus if they can identify the triangular Boolean statement as well.</iconp>

- [ ] **Model** the steps to reading conditionals as you complete your own bot on the board. When you read each Boolean statement read it “... is true”.

	Steps for reading code with conditionals:
**Don't forget to also read any code that is before and after the conditional in order.**
	1. Read the If statement.
	1. ✔ if the Boolean is true, read and execute what is inside the conditional
	1. ✘ if the Boolean is false, skip what is inside the conditional

- [ ] **Explore:** Students draw cards following the teacher model to complete their own bot.

> > “Your turn. Follow my steps and don’t forget to use your index card as you build your own bot.”

<br/>

- [ ] **Share:** If time allows, call up a couple of volunteers to share their bots with the class.

## 3. Explain: Code Along (25 min)
Participation: Whole Class Online

- [ ] **Code Along:** Play the code along videos while students follow along on their computers to write conditionals in Scratch.

> > “Now that you've gotten comfortable with conditionals, let's code along as we learn how to write conditionals in Scratch.
