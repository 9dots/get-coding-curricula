## Purpose
1. Empower students to use computational thinking practices to analyze problems, build solutions, and be creative.
2. Empower teachers to teach coding / best practices in computational thinking instruction.
3. Empowering students to share code to communicate their thinking , open their thinking up to critique, and revise their thinking.


## Big Goals
- Students will identify as coders.
- Students will experience mistakes as learning opportunities.
- Students will apply core computational thinking concepts (algorithms, pattern recognition, control, and abstraction) to problem solving.
- Students will be fluent in reading, writing, and debugging code.
- Students will share, defend, and revise their thinking based on evidence.

## Understandings
Students will understand that...

1. Programs can be shared, discuss, critiqued, and revised.
2. Programs are built iteratively and collaboratively through a cycle of planning, coding, and validating.
3. Bugs in programs are inevitable and can be fixed
systematically by comparing, finding, and fixing.
4. Coders fearlessly take on problems and challenges and view mistakes as opportunities for reflection and learning.

## Essential Questions
1. How are algorithms, patterns and loops used to solve problems?
2. What is the most efficient way to fix a bug in my code?
3. How do I learn from a mistake?
