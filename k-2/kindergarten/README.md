Students then apply this skill to write 2-5 line sequences of code.|I can control the actions of my PixelBot with code.|
|[Lesson 07: Code Your PixelBot](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-nrZucBrq6EMnCzjSFfjY2CZNuR6JC8Y9r9SorvDjXM)|In lesson 7 students continue writing code. The complexity of the challenges is increased by the minimum number of lines of code needed in the solution.|I can write a 2-5 line sequence of code.|
|[Lesson 08: Code Your PixelBot II](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1J_muEjOCS_Ubd0PdBKfw1hKwYbJ9D5LCGBKK30G3XSg)|In lesson 8 students continue to practice writing code to solve challenges that are similar to those in lesson 7.|I can write a 2-5 line sequence of code.|
|[Lesson 09: Find the Bug](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1so_ufRCu6WpzeIFavgvGRZmZj0FTrqG5TzrcZWtmGGE)|In lesson 9 students are introduced to the concept of debugging. Students use the stepping skills practiced in a previous lesson to find and remove unwanted lines of code.|I can find and remove a bug in a 2-5 line sequence of code.|
|[Lesson 10: Where is the Bug?](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RfCevwYTecDksz_w6haIoL48SKvPJXFvTunrEpbTnqo)|In lesson 10 students continue practicing their debugging skills by removing unwanted lines of code.|I can find and remove a bug in a 2-5 line sequence of code.|
|[Lesson 11: Code-a-thon](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11b0Jk8TbD97xmpsKN5Ytkmu3dJctv92-aWYV4qJzlC0)|In lesson 11 students tackle increasingly complex coding challenges that require writing longer solutions.|I can write a 6-10 line sequence of code.|
|[Lesson 12: Review](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Gg1wXeQYsodPqoq4fr_ICjiA6U-zuLz4i6l8d4xUmKw)|In lesson 12 students review the concepts and skills covered in lessons 1-11 in preparation for the Independent Coding Challenge (ICC) in Lesson 13. Students practice by working through a PixelBot playlist that is aligned to the first ICC.|All objectives from lessons 1-11.|
|[Lesson 13: Independent Coding Challenge I](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1flV6YZyhnV2NgOVdQu7D56GF32ZRbGBTvgGrQl9fLyY)|Lesson 13 is an opportunity for students to show what they have learned by taking the Independent Coding Challenge. Students work through a series of reading, writing, and debugging challenges.|All objectives from lessons 1-11.|
|[Lesson 14: Invisible Bugs](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z4h3fpgVI4XJ23DlRn5-KBKZfuRm4XQ8YEGlg1fZbeA)|In lesson 14 students are introduced to a new type of bug. Students apply their debugging skills to fix code that is missing blocks.|I can add a missing line of code to fix a 2-5 line sequence of code.|
|[Lesson 15: Bug Detectives](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TDY0iQjCywXWo4jHg_6QUT-Xp2ounYjqOSzgVpr58sk)|In lesson 15 students continue debugging code with missing blocks. Students practice applying their debugging skills to challenges with increased line counts.|I can add a missing line of code to fix a 6-10 line sequence of code.|
