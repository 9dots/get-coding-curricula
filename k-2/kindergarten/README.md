## Purpose
1. Empower students to use computational thinking practices to analyze problems, build solutions, and be creative.
2. Empower teachers to teach coding / best practices in computational thinking instruction.
3. Empowering students to share code to communicate their thinking , open their thinking up to critique, and revise their thinking.


## Big Goals
- Students will identify as coders.
- Students will experience mistakes as learning opportunities.
- Students will apply core computational thinking concepts (algorithms, pattern recognition, control, and abstraction) to problem solving.
- Students will be fluent in reading, writing, and debugging code.
- Students will share, defend, and revise their thinking based on evidence.

## Understandings
Students will understand that...

1. Programs can be shared, discuss, critiqued, and revised.
2. Programs are built iteratively and collaboratively through a cycle of planning, coding, and validating.
3. Bugs in programs are inevitable and can be fixed
systematically by comparing, finding, and fixing.
4. Coders fearlessly take on problems and challenges and view mistakes as opportunities for reflection and learning.

## Essential Questions
1. How are algorithms, patterns and loops used to solve problems?
2. What is the most efficient way to fix a bug in my code?
4. How do I learn from a mistake?


## Sequence

| Title             | Description        | Objectives |Practice|
| ------------------|--------------------| -----------|--------|
| Lesson 1: Mystery Robot | In lesson 1 students are introduced to the concept of productive failure through a story about a little girl and her quest to build a magnificent machine. Students discuss their takeaways from the story and apply the productive failure mindset to solve a mystery.| I can identify what I learned from my mistakes.|Debugging |
| Lesson 2: pixelBotGo |In lesson 2 students develop a set of commands to communicate with their pixelBot. The commands are then used to code solutions for a series of navigation challenges that require a single line of code.|I can develop and use a set of commands to direct my pixelBot’s movements.|Write|
| Lesson 3: Multiple Steps|In lesson 3 students use multiple commands to direct their pixelBot’s movement.|I can use more than one command to move my pixelBot.|Write|
| Lesson 4: pixelBot Code|In lesson 4 students continue writing code using the arrow commands that were developed in the previous lesson. The complexity of the challenges is increased by the minimum number of lines of code needed in the solution.|I can use more than one command to move my pixelBot.|Write|
| Lesson 5: Step-by-Step|In lesson 5 students practice reading code by stepping one line at a time. |I can step through a 2-5 line sequence of code.|Read|
| Lesson 6: Find the Bug|In lesson 6 students are introduced to the concept of debugging. Students use the stepping skills practiced in the previous lesson to find and remove unwanted lines of code. |I can find and remove a bug in a 2-5 line sequence of code.|Debug|
| Lesson 7: Invisible Bugs|In lesson 7 students continue debugging by identifying locations where code is missing. Students step through the sequence of code, identify where a line of code is missing, and add the missing code.|I can add a missing line of code to fix a 2-5 line sequence of code.|Debug|
| Lesson 8: Code-a-thon|In lesson 8 students tackle increasingly complex coding challenges by using the plan, code, validate protocol.|I can write a 6-10 line sequence of code.|Write|
| Lesson 9: Step It Up|In lesson 9 students practice stepping through increasingly complex code. |I can step through a 6-10 line sequence of code.|Read|
| Lesson 10: Where is the Bug?|In lesson 10 students use the compare, find, fix, debugging protocol to identify and remove bugs in increasingly complex code.|I can find and remove a bug in a 6-10 line sequence of code.|Debug|
| Lesson 11: Where is the Bug?|In lesson 11 students use the compare, find, fix debugging protocol to add missing lines of code to increasingly complex code.|I can add a missing line of code to fix a 6-10 line sequence of code.|Debug|
| Lesson 12: Review|In lesson 12 students review in preparation for Independent Coding Challenge I. |I can write 2-10 line sequences of code. I can step through 2-10 line sequences of code. I can find and remove bugs in 2-10 line sequences of code. |Review|
| Lesson 13: Independent Coding Challenge I|In lesson 13 students take the Independent Coding Challenge I.|I can write 2-10 line sequences of code. I can step through 2-10 line sequences of code. I can find and remove bugs in 2-10 line sequences of code. |Assessment|
| Lesson 14: Patterns|In lesson 14 students learn how to identify the core of a pattern and the number of times it repeats. The lesson begins with an introduction to patterns in which students examine a series of color, number, shape, and animal patterns in order to develop a definition of a pattern as a class. Students then learn to continue existing patterns as a way to identify the core of a pattern.|I can identify the core of a pattern and the number of times it repeats.|Read|
| Lesson 15: Patterns in Code|In lesson 15 students apply their ability to identify the core of a pattern and the number of times it repeats in the context of pixelBot code.|I can identify the core of a pattern and the number of times it repeats in a sequence of code|Read|
| Lesson 16: Repeat It|In lesson 16 students apply their ability to identify the core of a pattern and the number of times it repeats to refactor sequences of pixelBot code with loops.|I can repeat a sequence of code.|Write|
| Lesson 17: Looping Back|In lesson 17 students learn how to read loops and practice stepping through them.|I can step through a loop of code.|Read|
| Lesson 18: Loopy Bugs|In lesson 18 students apply their ability to step through loops to find and remove bugs.|I can find and remove a bug in a loop of code.|Debug|
| Lesson 19: Buggy Loops|In lesson 19 students apply their ability to step through loops to add missing lines of code to loops.|I can add a missing line of code to a loop.|Debug|
| Lesson 20: Decomposing Letters|In lesson 20 students are introduced to decomposition. Students develop their own definition and learn to produce usable decompositions.|I can decompose an image into smaller, usable pieces.|Write|
| Lesson 21: Decompose and Code|In lesson 21 students code images by using decomposition in the planning phase.|I can code a decomposed image.|Write|
