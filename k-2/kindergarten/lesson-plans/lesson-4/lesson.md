## 1. Engage: Observe & Predict (8 min)
**Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Introduce** the demo challenge.

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge as a class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>

Follow up questions:
  <iconp type='question'>What do you think the blocks do?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Where is the PixelBot standing on the grid?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What do you think the buttons under the grid do?</iconp>

  <note type='tip'>The first question in the engage activity is meant to give students the opportunity to call out anything they notice about the challenge. The subsequent questions are follow-ups that are meant to guide students to make relevant observations. Ideally, this process is being increasingly internalized by the students each time it is done.

  By the end of this activity students should be aware of the:
  - presence of code blocks in the editor
  - the reading controls under the grid
  - location of the PixelBot on the grid</note>

- [ ] **Explain** how to read code from top to bottom.
>>"In this challenge we are going to read the code on the right like a computer. We will make our PixelBot do everything we see in the code in order from top to bottom. If we see an arrow in the code, we will click on the matching arrow underneath the grid to make our PixelBot move in the correct direction."

- [ ] **Introduce** students to the paint block.
>>"The blue code block with the square tells the PixelBot to paint a square. Whenever you see that block it means the PixelBot has to paint the square it is standing on. We can do this by clicking the paint bucket underneath the grid."

 - [ ] **Model** solving the demo challenge for the class.
 >>"Let's see what the PixelBot paints. ________________________________"

## 2. Explore: Try It Out (5 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Introduce and unpack** challenge number 1 in the practice playlist as a class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>


Follow up questions:
  <iconp type='question'>Where is the PixelBot standing on the grid?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many lines of code are we going to step through?</iconp>


- [ ] **Challenge** the class to complete challenge number 1.

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students try completing challenge number 1.

## 3. Explain: Reading Challenges (5 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have students share out what they found the code directs the PixelBot to paint.

<iconp type='question'>What did the PixelBot paint?</iconp>

- [ ] **Model** solving challenge number 1.
>>"Let's see what the PixelBot paints. ________________________________"

## 4. Elaborate/Evaluate: PixelBot Practice (12 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot extension playlist.
