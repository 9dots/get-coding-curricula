## 1. Engage/Explore: Choose a Path (10 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** Challenge 1.
>>"Alright coders, today we are going to continue practicing our coding skills by solving some challenges. Our first challenge of the day is on the board. Take the next 20 seconds to do your best to observe the grid, PixelBot and code."

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge as a class.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about this challenge?**</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What else do you notice?</iconp>

<note type='tip'>By the end of this activity students should be aware of the:
  - goal of the challenge
  - number of squares that need to be painted</note>

- [ ] **Model** planning a route that the PixelBot will take to complete the challenge using a marker or use the slide animations.
>>'In this challenge I want our PixelBot to paint two squares. There is more than one way to complete this challenge so I have to choose one. I want to paint the square that is closest to the PixelBot first so I will make it move up, the to the right and paint. Then I will do the same thing again to paint the second square.'

- [ ] **Code** a solution as a class by having students share out code blocks they would use. As students share try their ideas from your computer. Prompt students using the questions below. Continue pulling student ideas until the group has arrived at a solution.

<iconp type='question'>What code block should we use first?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What code block should we use next?</iconp>

## 2. Explain: Guided Coding (10 min)
- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge 2 as a class.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about this challenge?**</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What else do you notice?</iconp>

- [ ] **Explain** that a key part of coding is planning what your code should do. In PixelBots that means planning a path for the PixelBot to travel.
>>"One of the most important things coders do happens before they ever write code. Coders always plan their code before they begin writing code. When we code in PixelBots that means we have to plan which way our PixelBot should go, just like we did in the first challenge. Let's plan our path for Challenge 2."


- [ ] **Plan** the path the PixelBot will take as a class by having student volunteers trace 2 different paths using markers on the board. Have the class vote on the path they should code.
>>"Let's work together to find a path for our PixelBot. Just like I did earlier, we are going to trace a path for our PixelBot on the board."

<iconp type='question'>Which way should the PixelBot go?</iconp>

<note type='tip'>If students need help identifying a path to paint the 3 squares, model one path and then prompt students to share a different path.</note>

- [ ] **Explain** that there are many ways of completing the challenge. Use the different paths as an example.
>>"There is always more than one way to solve a problem. In this challenge we found 2 different paths we can code. This is why we have to plan before we start to code. We need to know which of the solutions we are trying to code so that we can tell when our code is not doing what we want it to do."

- [ ] **Code** a solution as a class by having students share out code blocks they would use. As students share try their ideas from your computer. Prompt students using the questions below. Continue pulling student ideas until the group has arrived at a solution.

<iconp type='question'>What code block should we use first?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What code block should we use next?</iconp>


## 3. Elaborate/Evaluate: PixelBot Practice (10 min)

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to code solutions for the all of the challenges in the playlist.
>>"Alright coders, now it's your turn to solve some challenges. Your goal is to find a path for your PixelBot and code a solution in each challenge. Let's begin!"

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot extension playlist.
