In lesson 11 students practice debugging code by removing unwanted lines of code.

- I can find and remove a bug in a 6-10 line sequence of code.

## 1. Engage: Unpacking (10 min)
**Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Introduce** the first debugging challenge of the day.
>> "Alright coders, today we are going to practice our debugging skills! Our first challenge of the day is on the board. Take the next 20 seconds to do your best to observe the grid, PixelBot and code."

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge as a class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What color does it need to paint the square?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Is the PixelBot facing the square it needs to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What else do you notice?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>

<note>The first question in the engage activity is meant to give students the opportunity to call out anything they notice about the challenge. The subsequent questions are follow-ups that are meant to guide students to make the types of relevant observations they should make every time they approach a challenge. By the end of this activity students should be aware of the:
  - goal of the challenge
  - position of the PixelBot
  - orientation of the PixelBot
  - presence of starter code</note>

## 2. Explore: Where is the Bug? (2 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to fix the code without deleting everything and rewriting it.
>>“Your challenge in this activity is to fix the code by only changing the part that doesn’t work. You should not delete all of the code and rewrite it.”

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students attempt to debug the code on their own.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class to find students that can be called on to share their strategies in the next activity.

<note>Beginning coders tend to debug by deleting all of their code and starting all over again. Emphasis should be put on motivating students to fix the source of the issue rather than rewriting all of their code.</note>

## 3. Explain: Debugging Code (8 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Think, Pair, Share:** Students share their responses to the questions below with a partner. After each partner has shared, call on students to share with the rest of the class.

<iconp type='question'>What changes did you make?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How did you know to make those changes?</iconp>

- [ ] **Remind** students that one type of bug they will continue to encounter are extra lines of unwanted code.

- [ ] **Introduce** challenge number two.
>>"Here is our second challenge today. Take the next 20 seconds to observe the grid, PixelBot and the code."

- [ ] **Unpack** challenge number two as a class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What color does it need to paint the square?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Is the PixelBot facing the square it needs to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What else do you notice?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>

  - [ ] **Model** debugging challenge number two.

  ***>>"add scripting here after the playlist has been created"****

## 4. Elaborate/Evaluate: PixelBot Playlist (10 min)
**Location:** Desks
- [ ] **Challenge** the class to debug the code in the playlist by removing only the extra lines of code.
>>"Your challenge is to debug the code in each challenge by only deleting the line of code that is not needed. You should not delete all of the code and start over again."

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot extension playlist.
