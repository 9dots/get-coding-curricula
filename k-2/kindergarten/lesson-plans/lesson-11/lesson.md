## 1. Engage: Choose a Path (10 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** challenge number one.
>>"Alright coders, today we are going to continue practicing our coding skills by solving some challenges. Our first challenge of the day is on the board. Take the next 20 seconds to do your best to observe the grid, PixelBot and code."

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge as a class.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about this challenge?**</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What color does it need to paint the squares?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What else do you notice?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>

<note type='tip'>The first question in the engage activity is meant to give students the opportunity to call out anything they notice about the challenge. The subsequent questions are follow-ups that are meant to guide students to make the types of relevant observations they should make every time they approach a challenge. By the end of this activity students should be aware of the:
  - goal of the challenge
  - position of the PixelBot
  - orientation of the PixelBot
  - code blocks available to complete the challenge</note>

- [ ] **Plan** a route that the PixelBot will take to complete the challenge as a class. Using a marker have the class help you trace out a path on the slide.

## 2. Explore: Code It (2 min)
- [ ] **Challenge** the class to code their PixelBot to follow the path that the class decided on.

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students attempt to code the solution.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class to find a student that can be called on to share their strategies in the next activity. Once a student has been identified let them know that they will share with the class.

## 3. Explain: Share Your Code (8 min)
- [ ] **Think, Pair, Share:** Students share their responses to the questions below with a partner. After each partner has shared, call on students to share with the rest of the class.

<iconp type='question'>What was hard about coding your solution?</iconp>

- [ ] **Code Share:** Invite a student to share their code with the class.

- [ ] **Explain** how to plan a path before starting to code a solution using challenge two in the playlist. Students should be made aware that there are multiple ways to solve a challenge that are all valid.
>>"Take a look at our next challenge. There are many ways to solve this challenge. I can..."

## 4. Elaborate/Evaluate: PixelBot Practice (10 min)

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to code solutions for the all of the challenges in the playlist.
>>"Alright coders, now it's your turn to solve some challenges. Your goal is to find a path for your PixelBot and code a solution in each challenge. Let's begin!"

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot extension playlist.
