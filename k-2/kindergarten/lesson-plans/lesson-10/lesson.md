## 1. Engage/Explore: Unpack & Debug (10 min)
**Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Introduce** the first debugging challenge of the day.
>> "Alright coders, today we are going to practice our debugging skills! Our first challenge of the day is on the board. Take the next 20 seconds to do your best to observe the grid, PixelBot and code."

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge as a class.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about this challenge?**</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What else do you notice?</iconp>
<br/>

<note type='tip'>By the end of this activity students should be aware of the:
  - goal of the challenge
  - presence of starter code</note>

- [ ] **Reveal** the bug to students by running the code and continue to unpack the challenge with the class.
  <iconp type='question'>What did the PixelBot do?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What was the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>.
<br/>
  <note type='tip'>The purpose of running the code is for students to notice that there is a bug in the code by observing that the PixelBots actions don't match the intended outcome.</note>

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to help you fix the code without deleting everything and rewriting it.
>>“Oh no! It looks like our code has a bug. Our challenge in this activity is to debug the code by only deleting the part that doesn’t work. We cannot delete all of the code and rewrite it.”

- [ ] **Elicit** student ideas about how to debug the code. Try student ideas from your computer as students share out. Continue this process until the group has debugged the code.
  <iconp type='question'>What can we do to find the bug?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>We can use the stepper tool to read the code one line at a time.</iconp>

  <iconp type='question'>What line of code is the bug on? Why do you think that?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>The bug is on line 4.</iconp>

  <iconp type='question'>What should we do to fix the bug?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Delete line 4 of the code.</iconp>
<br/>
- [ ] **Think, Pair, Share:** Students reflect on the process of debugging by sharing their responses to the questions below with a partner. After each partner has shared, call on students to share with the rest of the class.
<iconp type='question'>What did we do to find and fix the code?</iconp>
<br/>
- [ ] **Review** the key steps the class used to debug the code. Emphasize stepping through the code using the stepper tool.
>>"We debugged our code by stepping through it to find where the code made the PixelBot do something we didn't want to happen. When we debug code we should always try reading it one line at a time using the yellow stepper tool, just like we did in our last lesson."


## 2. Explain: Debugging Review (5 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge Two as a class.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about this challenge?**</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What else do you notice?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Reveal** the bug to students by running the code.
<iconp type='question'>What did the PixelBot do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What was the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>."
<br/>

- [ ] **Model** debugging Challenge 2 in the playlist by using the stepper tool to find the extra line of code.
>>"This code is supposed to paint one square at the top middle part of the grid. When I step through the code it paints two squares instead. The paint block on line 3 paints a square it's not supposed to paint. This is the bug. I can fix the bug by deleting line 3. When I run the code, the PixelBot paints the correct square only."

## 3. Elaborate/Evaluate: PixelBots Practice (15 min)
**Location:** Desks
- [ ] **Challenge** the class to debug the code in challenges 1-5 in the PixelBots playlist.
>>"Your challenge is to debug the code in each challenge by only deleting the line of code that is not needed. You should not delete all of the code and start over again."

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish challenges 1-5 to complete the bonus challenges in the playlist.
