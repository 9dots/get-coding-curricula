## 1. Elaborate: Independent Coding Challenge (25 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Introduce** the lesson.
>> "In today's class  we are going to get a chance to show what we have learned by taking the Independent Coding Challenge!"

- [ ] **Explain** that the class will be doing a mixture of reading, writing, and debugging challenges. Then show students how to identify the type of challenge in the playlist.
>> "Just like in our last lesson, the playlist today will include reading, writing, and debugging challenges. When we start a challenge, we should always look at the picture in the corner to know what we should do in the challenge. When we see the yellow book it means that we will read the code and make our PixelBot move using the buttons below. When we see the blue pencil and paper it means that we will write code to solve the challenge and when we see the red square with the bug inside it means we will have to debug the code we are given.

- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students work through the Independent Coding Challenge.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional help. Student progress may be monitored through [schools.pixelbots.io][schools].

## 2. Evaluate: Reflect (5 mins)
**Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Reflect:** Students reflect on how they feel about coding class.
