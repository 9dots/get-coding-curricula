<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 13 students learned how to decompose grid images into their simpler elements, lines and dots. Lesson 14 builds on this skill by teaching students its usefulness in coding increasingly complex images. Students use their decompositions from lesson 13 to code images of the letters they originally composed.

## 1. Engage: Decomposition Review (5 min)
- [ ] **Review** how to pronounce the word decompose. Slides 2-7

- [ ] **Review** the decomposition hand gesture and have the class practice using it.

<iconp type='question'>Can someone show me what the hand gesture for the word decompose looks like?
</iconp>

- [ ] **Show** examples of decomposition. Slides 8-10

- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Students discuss the definition of the word decompose.
<iconp type='question'>Can someone remind us what the word decompose means?</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Partner pairs share out their definition of the word decompose.
- [ ] **Define** decompose.
>> “Decompose means to break something apart into smaller pieces. Each of the images we just saw shows something being broken into smaller pieces.”

- [ ] **Connect** the previous lesson to today's lesson.
>> “Last week we learned how to decompose letters into lines and dots. Today we are going to see why it’s helpful to decompose things we want to code.”

- [ ] **Demonstrate** how a complex coding challenge can be made easier through decomposition. Slide 11-13
>> "In this example someone coded a happy face by decomposing it. They first coded the eyes. Then they coded the smile and the outline of the head. Decomposing makes it easier to code because it lets you turn one big coding challenge into a group of smaller challenges."

## 2. Explain: Decompose to Code (10 min)
- [ ] **Model** decomposing letters with the letter L. Slides 14-17
>>"It is easier to code the letter L if we decompose it into lines and dots. Just like we did last week, we'll look for as many lines as possible. In the letter L we have two lines."

![letter](./images/letter-l.png)

- [ ] **Model** coding the letter L one piece at a time. Slides 18-19
>> "Once we have decomposed the letter we can code it one piece at a time. We should always start by coding the line that is closest to the bot."

- [ ] **Guided Practice:** The class works together to code the letter T using the [decomposed letters sheet][sheets].
  - [ ] **Show** that the first decomposition on the decomposed letters sheet is labeled with the number 1 at the top of the grid. Then point out the comment in playlist problem 1. Explain that the comment is simply there to show where the code for decomposition 1 should go.
  - [ ] **Group Coding:** Have volunteers suggest lines of code that will complete decomposition 1 of the letter T.
  - [ ] **Repeat** the same process for decomposition 2 in playlist problem 2.
  - [ ] **Group Coding:** Combine the code to complete the letter T in problem 3. Code for decomposition 1 should be written below comment 1 and code for decomposition 2 should be written below comment 2.

## 3. Elaborate: Independent Practice (15 min)
- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students code the letters T, H, C, and Y on the Decomposition II Playlist.
- [ ] **Monitor** the room for students in need of additional assistance.
- [ ] **Review** how to code the letter H.
