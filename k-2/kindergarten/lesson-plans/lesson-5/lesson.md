<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 4 students practice reading code by stepping through it one line at a time on PixelBots.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can step through a 6-10 line sequence of code.

## 1. Engage: Observe & Predict (5 min)
**Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Introduce** the challenge number 1 from the practice playlist.

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge as a class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>

Follow up questions:
  <iconp type='question'>What kinds of blocks are in the code?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many lines of code do you see?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Where is the PixelBot on the grid?</iconp>

  <note type='tip'>The first question in the engage activity is meant to give students the opportunity to call out anything they notice about the challenge. The subsequent questions are follow-ups that are meant to guide students to make relevant observations. Ideally, this process is being increasingly internalized by the students each time it is done.

  By the end of this activity students should be aware of the:
  - the types of blocks found in the code
  - the number of lines of code in the editor
  - location of the PixelBot on the grid</note>

## 2. Explore: Try It Out (2 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to complete challenge number 1.

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students try completing challenge number 1.

## 3. Explain: Reading Challenges (5 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have students share out what they found the code directs the PixelBot to paint.

<iconp type='question'>What did the PixelBot paint?</iconp>

- [ ] **Model** solving challenge number 1.
>>"Let's see what the PixelBot paints. ________________________________"

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge 2 as a class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>

Follow up questions:
  <iconp type='question'>What kinds of blocks are in the code?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many lines of code do you see?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Where is the PixelBot on the grid?</iconp>

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to complete challenge 2 and the rest of the PixelBot playlist.

## 4. Elaborate/Evaluate: PixelBot Practice (18 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot extension playlist.
