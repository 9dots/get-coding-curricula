<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 8 students continue debugging by identifying locations where code is missing. Students step through the sequence of code, identify where a line of code is missing, and add the missing code.

- I can add a missing line of code to debug a 2-5 line sequence of code.

## 1. Engage: Debug the Car (5 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** the broken car scenario by reading the bullet pointed story on the slide.

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have students share out their responses to question below.

<iconp type='question'>How is this an example of debugging?</iconp>

- [ ] **Explain** how fixing the car is an example of debugging.
>>"This story is an example of debugging because the woman had to figure out what the problem was and then she had to fix it. When we debug code we do the same things. We find the problem and then we fix it.

- [ ] **Explain** why debugging is preferable over completely deleting code and starting all over again.
>>"When the woman in the story found a problem with her car she didn't throw it away and find a new car. She found the problem and then she fixed it. Sometimes when we debug it may be tempting to just erase all of our hard work and start all over again, but it's better to find the bug and fix it. We shouldn't throw away our hard work just like the woman didn't throw away her car."

## 2. Explore: Debug the Code (5 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** debugging challenge one.
- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students attempt to complete the debugging challenge.
- [ ] **
should highlight that the bug the is different from the previous lesson. Not extra lines of code. the bug is a missing line of code.
have students work on the challenge

## 3. Explain: Invisible Bugs (5 min)
students discuss what they found in the challenge
explain that missing lines of code are Bugs
model how to solve the challenge with the stepper

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBot Practice (10 min)
- [ ] **Explain** that the goal of each challenge is to debug the code by adding the missing line of code.
>>"Each of our next challenges has a bug. The bug in each challenge is an extra line of code that makes the PixelBot do something we don't want. Our goal is to debug the code by finding and deleting the extra line of code.

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot extension playlist.

## 5. Evaluate: Exit Challenge (5 min)

- [ ] **Exit Challenge:** Have students complete the exit challenge playlist on PixelBots.
