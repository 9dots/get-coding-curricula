## 1. Engage/Explore: Unpack & Code (12 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** challenge 1 from the practice playlist.
>>"Today we are going to continue to code our PixelBots. Just like in out last class, we are going to start with a challenge. Take the next 15 seconds to look at the challenge on the board. Once you notice something, raise your hand to share it with the group."

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge as a class.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about the challenge on the board?**</iconp>
    <iconp type='question'>Where is the PixelBot on the grid?</iconp>
    <iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing?</iconp>
    <iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
    <iconp type='question'>Which square does the PixelBot have to paint?</iconp>
    <iconp type='question'>Which way should the PixelBot move to get to the square?</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out and Model:** Have student share out their answers to the question below. Test their ideas by adding code in the editor clicking run. Continue asking the question and testing out their ideas until the group comes up with a solution to challenge 1.

<iconp type='question'>Which code block on the board will get our PixelBot to move closer to the square it needs to paint?</iconp>

## 2. Explain: Writing Code (8 min)
- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge 2 as a class.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about the challenge on the board?**</iconp>
    <iconp type='question'>Where is the PixelBot on the grid?</iconp>
    <iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing?</iconp>
    <iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
    <iconp type='question'>Which square does the PixelBot have to paint?</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out and Model:** Have student share out their answers to the questions below. Test their ideas by adding code in the editor clicking run. Continue this process until the group comes up with a solution to challenge 2.

<iconp type='question'>Which code block should we use first?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which code block should we use next?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which code block should we use last?</iconp>

## 3. Elaborate/Evaluate: PixelBot Practice (10 min)
- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

<note type='tip'>Consider pausing during independent work time to give students a helpful tip or inspirational message.</note>

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot extension playlist.

<note type='tip'>Check challenges 3 and 4 in the practice playlist to track student progress.</note>
