<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 8 students continue debugging by identifying locations where code is missing. Students step through the sequence of code, identify where a line of code is missing, and add the missing code.


<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can add a missing line of code to debug a 2-5 line sequence of code.

## 1. Engage: Observations (10 min)
**Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Review** debugging by having students share what they remember from the previous lesson.
>>"In our last lesson we learned about bugs and debugging. I'm looking for some coders to share what they remember from that lesson."

<iconp type='question'>What is a bug?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What does it mean to debug code?</iconp>

- [ ] **Introduce** the first challenge of the day.
>>"In our first challenge of the day we are going to practice our debugging skills."

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge as a class by having students share out their observations about the goal and starting conditions of the grid.
>> "Take a moment to observe the PixelBot, grid and code."

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about this challenge?**</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot have to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Which square on the grid needs to be painted?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Which square is the PixelBot standing on?</iconp>

- [ ] **Execute** the code by clicking the run button and have students observe the PixelBot's actions.
>>"I am going to run the code. When I click run I want you to do your best to observe what the PixelBot does. I am going to ask a few coders to share out what they saw."

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have students share out their observations.

<iconp type='question'>What did the PixelBot do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Did the PixelBot paint the correct square?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Does this code contain a bug? How do you know?</iconp>

## 2. Explore: Try It Out (2 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Explain** that the goal of the challenge is to fix the bug without deleting the whole sequence and starting from the beginning.
- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students attempt to debug the code independently.
- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students you can call on to share out their solution.

## 3. Explain: Invisible Bugs (8 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Have students discuss the question below with a classmate.
<iconp type='question'>What did you do to fix your code?</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have students share out what they did to fix their code.
<iconp type='question'>What did you do to fix your code?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Why did you try that?</iconp>

- [ ] **Explain** that missing lines of code are bugs.
>>"In this challenge the bug was that a line of code was missing. The PixelBot was supposed to move up 2 times and paint, but it moved up 2 times and didn't paint the square. To fix it we had to add another paint block at the end. Missing lines of code are a common bug we will find in our PixelBot code."

- [ ] **Introduce** the PixelBot Playlist.
>>"In today's challenges we are going to debug by adding code that is missing. Just like you did in this first challenge."

- [ ] **Model** debugging challenge 2 in the playlist by using the stepper tool to find the spot where code is missing.
>>"This code is supposed to make the PixelBot paint a square 2 spaces to the right. When I run the code the PixelBot moves 2 spaces to the right but it does not paint. I can reset my PixelBot and use the yellow stepper button to step through my code one line at a time. It looks like each step works but there is a missing paint block at the end. To fix it I put my cursor at the end and add the paint block."

## 4. Elaborate/Evaluate: PixelBot Playlist (10 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to debug the code in the playlist by adding the missing line of code in each challenge.
>>"Your challenge is to debug the code in each challenge by only adding the line of code that is missing. You should not delete all of the code and start over again."

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Have students work through the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot extension playlist.
