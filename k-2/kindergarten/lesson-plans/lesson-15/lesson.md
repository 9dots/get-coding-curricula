<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 15 students continue debugging code with missing blocks. Students practice applying their debugging skills to challenges with increased line counts.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can add a missing line of code to fix a 6-10 line sequence of code.

## 1. Engage/Explore: Unpack & Debug  (10 min)
**Location:** Rug
- [ ] **Introduce** the lesson’s objective.
>>“Today we are going to continue debugging code that has missing blocks. In today’s challenge our code will be longer so we have to be extra careful when we are looking for bugs.”

- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge 1 as a class.
<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What else do you notice?</iconp>
<br/>

<note type='tip'>
By the end of this activity students should be aware of the:
- goal of the challenge
- presence of starter code
</note>

- [ ] **Reveal** the bug to students by running the code and continue to unpack the challenge with the class.
<iconp type='question'>What did the PixelBot do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What was the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
<br/>

<note type='tip'>
The purpose of running the code is for students to notice that there is a bug in the code by observing that the PixelBot’s actions don't match the intended outcome.
</note>

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to help you fix the code without deleting everything and rewriting it.
>>“Our code is missing a block. Let’s try to debug it by finding where the block is missing.”

- [ ] **Elicit** student ideas about how to debug the code. Try student ideas from your computer as students share out. Continue this process until the group has debugged the code.
<iconp type='question'>What can we do to find the bug?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Where is the bug in the code? How do you know?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What should we do to fix the code?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Think, Pair, Share:** Students reflect on the process of debugging by sharing their responses to the questions below with a partner. After each partner has shared, call on students to share with the rest of the class.
<iconp type='question'>What did we do to find and fix the bug?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What was different about how we debugged the code in this challenge?</iconp>

## 2. Explain: Missing Code (8 min)
- [ ] **Review** the key steps the class used to debug the code. Emphasize stepping through the code using the stepper tool to find the spot in the code where something unexpected happens.
>>“We debugged our code by stepping through it one line at a time to find where it did something we didn’t want. Once we found where something we didn’t want happened, we looked at the blocks to decide what should happen at this spot. In Challenge 1 we needed to add a paint block on line 4.”

- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge 2 as a class.
<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What else do you notice?</iconp>
<br/>
- [ ] **Reveal** the bug to students by running the code.
<iconp type='question'>What did the PixelBot do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What was the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ] **Model** debugging Challenge 2 in the playlist by using the stepper tool to find the missing line of code.
>>“When I step through the code with the yellow stepper button the PixelBot moves one step to the right and then it paints. This is not where I want it to paint. This means that this is where the bug is. If I add an ‘up’ block after the ‘move right’ block the PixelBot will be on the correct square when it paints.”

## 3. Elaborate/Evaluate: Debug (12 min)
- [ ] **Challenge** the class to debug the code in the playlist by adding the missing code.

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Review:** Students who finish early can work on the bonus review challenges in the playlist. Bonus challenges review stepping through code one line at a time.
