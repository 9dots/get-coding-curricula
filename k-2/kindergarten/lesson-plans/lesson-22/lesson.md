## 1. Engage: Observe & Predict (5 min)
**Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Introduce** the challenge number 1 from the practice playlist.

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge as a class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>

Follow up questions:
  <iconp type='question'>What kinds of blocks are in the code?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many lines of code do you see?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Where is the PixelBot on the grid?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many times does this code repeat?</iconp>

<note type='tip'>
  By the end of this activity students should be aware of the:
  - the types of blocks found in the code
  - the number of lines of code in the editor
  - location of the PixelBot on the grid
  - the number of times the code should repeat</note>

## 2. Explore: Try It Out (2 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to complete challenge number 1.

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students try completing challenge number 1.

## 3. Explain: Reading Challenge (5 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have students share out what they found the code directs the PixelBot to paint.

<iconp type='question'>What did the PixelBot paint?</iconp>

- [ ] **Model** solving challenge number 1.
>>"Let's see what the PixelBot paints. ________________________________"

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge 2 as a class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>

Follow up questions:
  <iconp type='question'>What kinds of blocks are in the code?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many lines of code do you see?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Where is the PixelBot on the grid?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many times does this code repeat?</iconp>

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to complete challenge 2 and the rest of the PixelBot playlist.

## 4. Elaborate: Independent Practice (12 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot extension playlist.
