<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 7 students are introduced to the concept of debugging. Students use the stepping skills practiced in a previous lesson to find and remove unwanted lines of code.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>

- I can find and remove a bug in a 2-5 line sequence of code.

## 1. Engage: What is a Bug? (5 min)
- [ ] **Read** the story of the first bug.
<iconp type='question'>Why was it important for the computer scientists not to give up?</iconp>

- [ ] **Define** bug and debugging.
>> "A bug is an error found in code. Debugging is what we do when we find and fix bugs in our code."

- [ ] **Explain** the importance of debugging.
>> "Bugs happen all of the time when we code. Even the best coders in the world have bugs in their code. That means that to become good coders we have to be good at debugging. The most important thing to remember when we debug is not to give up just like the computer scientists didn't give up in the story."

## 2. Explore: Debugging (5 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** students to the first debugging challenge in the playlist.
>>"In our first challenge today you can see that we already have code written for us, but we don't know if it works. Your challenge is to fix the code of it does not work. You should start by checking of the code works."

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students try to determine if the code has a bug using their computers. If the code is not valid students should try to debug it.

- [ ] **Review** the code's objective.
<iconp type='question'>What does the bot have to do?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>The code is supposed to make the PixelBot move up 3 spaces and paint a square.</iconp>

- [ ] **Discuss** what the code did as a class.
<iconp type='question'>What did the code do?</iconp>

- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Have students discuss in pairs how they attempted to fix the code.
<iconp type='question'>What did you do to figure it out?</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have volunteers share what they discuss with their partner.


## 3. Explain: Debugging Protocol (5 min)
- [ ] **Explain** that a common bug in PixelBots is having an extra line of code that isn't needed.
>>"In today's challenges we will debugging code that has extra lines that we don't need."

- [ ] **Model:** Using the same problem from the Explore activity, model the debugging protocol.
1. Compare what the code is supposed to do to what it actually does.
	>>"When I debug the first thing I do is ask myself what do I want the code to do? Then I ask myself, what does it do instead? The code is supposed to make the PixelBot go up 3 spaces and paint the square. Right now it goes up 4 spaces and paints a square. It goes too far.”
2. Find the bug.
	>>“Then second thing I do is try to find the bug. I can find the bug by using the stepper tool to find where the code does something I don't want it to do. As I check this code one line at a time I can see that the up arrow on line 4 needs to be deleted because it makes the bot go too far.
3. Try deleting the line of code and run the code to see if it works.
	>>“To fix the code I am going to try deleting the extra arrow on line 4. This should make the PixelBot move 3 spaces and then paint the block just like we wanted it to. Now if I click run it paints the correct square.”

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBot Practice (10 min)
- [ ] **Explain** that the goal of each challenge is to debug the code by finding and removing the extra line of code that makes the PixelBot do something we don't want.
>>"Each of our next challenges has a bug. The bug in each challenge is an extra line of code that makes the PixelBot do something we don't want. Our goal is to debug the code by finding and deleting the extra line of code.


- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot extension playlist.

## 5. Evaluate: Exit Challenge (5 min)

- [ ] **Exit Challenge:** Have students complete the exit challenge playlist on PixelBots.
