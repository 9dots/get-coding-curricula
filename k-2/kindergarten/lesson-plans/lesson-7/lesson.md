## 1. Engage: Code a Friend (5 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** the coding challenge in the demo playlist and invite a student to play the role of the PixelBot on the floor grid.
>> "Today we are going to continue to practice writing code on PixelBots. In our first challenge we need to move our PixelBot to the last square on right. We are going to complete this challenge as a class. I need a volunteer to come up to the rug and pretend to be our PixelBot. Would anyone like to be our PixelBot today?"

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have students help you write the code by volunteering to share one line at a time.

- [ ] **Stepping:** Have the student on the grid act out the code as you direct the class in reading the code out loud one line at a time.

- [ ] **Validate** the code by running it on PixelBots.

## 2. Explore: Challenge (3 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** PixelBot challenge 1 from the practice playlist to the class.
>> "In our next challenge we need to paint the square in the middle of the grid. You are going to try to solve this challenge on your own."

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students attempt to code a solution to challenge 1.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class to select two students who will share their code. Try to select two students with different solutions. If only one solution is found in the class prepare to share a different solution during the explain activity.

## 3. Explain: Writing Code (7 min)
- [ ] **Share Out:** Have students selected share their code. As they share, write the code in the editor and run it in order to validate the solution. If only one solution was found in the group share a different solution of your own.

- [ ] **Explain** that challenges usually have more than one solution and that it is important to know how you want to try to solve a challenge before beginning to code.
>> "Most of the challenges we will write code for have more than one solution. This is why it is important to plan which solution you are going to try before beginning to write code."

- [ ] **Demonstrate** how to plan a path by tracing an imaginary line with your finger on the grid to solve challenge 2 in the playlist. Have students repeat after you.
>> "One way I like to plan my code is by tracing the path I want my PixelBot to take with my finger before I write my code. In challenge 2 our goal is to paint the square that is above on the left. I can trace a path with my finger that goes up one space and then left one space."

- [ ] **Model** how to solve the challenge after tracing out the path with your finger.
>>"Now that I chose my path, I can start to write my code. First I need to move up one space. Then I need to move one space to the left. Finally, I should have my PixelBot paint the square."

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBot Practice (10 min)
- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot extension playlist.

## 5. Evaluate: Exit Challenge (5 min)

- [ ] **Exit Challenge:** Have students complete the exit challenge playlist on PixelBots.
