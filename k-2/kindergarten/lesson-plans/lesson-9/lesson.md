<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 9 students are introduced to the concept of debugging. Students use the stepping skills practiced in a previous lesson to find and remove unwanted lines of code.

- I can find and remove a bug in a 2-5 line sequence of code.

## 1. Engage: What is a Bug? (5 min)
**Location:** Rug
- [ ] **Read** the story of the first bug.
<iconp type='question'>Why was it important for the computer scientists not to give up?</iconp>

- [ ] **Define** bug and debugging.
>> "A bug is an error found in code. Debugging is what we do when we find and fix bugs in our code."

- [ ] **Explain** the importance of debugging.
>> "Bugs happen all of the time when we code. Even the best coders in the world have bugs in their code. That means that to become good coders we have to be good at debugging. The most important thing to remember when we debug is not to give up just like the computer scientists didn't give up in the story."

## 2. Explore: Try It Out (2 min)
**Location:** Desks
- [ ] **Introduce** students to the first debugging challenge in the playlist.
>>"In our first challenge today our PixelBot is supposed to paint the square above it. This challenge already has code. When I run the code it paints the wrong square. That means it has a bug in it.

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to fix the code without deleting the entire sequence.
>>"Your challenge is to debug the code without deleting all of your code and starting all over again."

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students attempt to debug the code on their own.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students you can call on to share out their solution.

## 3. Explain: Debugging Protocol (8 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Have students discuss the question below with a classmate.
<iconp type='question'>What did you do to fix your code?</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have students share out what they did to fix their code.
<iconp type='question'>What did you do to fix your code?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Why did you try that?</iconp>

- [ ] **Explain** that extra lines of code are bugs.
>>"In this challenge the bug was that there was an extra line of code that we didn't need. The PixelBot was supposed to move up 1 time and paint, but it moved up 2 times before painting. To fix it we had to remove the extra up block. Extra lines of code are a common bug we will find in our PixelBot code."

- [ ] **Introduce** the PixelBot Playlist.
>>"In today's challenges we are going to debug by deleting extra lines of code. Just like you did in this first challenge."

- [ ] **Model** debugging challenge 2 in the playlist by using the stepper tool to find the extra line of code.
>>"This code is supposed to make the PixelBot paint 1 square to the right. When I run the code the PixelBot paints a square above the one it is supposed to paint. I can reset my PixelBot and use the yellow stepper button to step through my code one line at a time. It looks like each step works but there is an extra up block that we do not need before the paint block. If I delete that line and run the code the PixelBot paints the correct block."

## 4. Elaborate/Evaluate: PixelBot Playlist (15 min)
**Location:** Desks
- [ ] **Challenge** the class to debug the code in the playlist by removing only the extra lines of code.
>>"Your challenge is to debug the code in each challenge by only deleting the line of code that is not needed. You should not delete all of the code and start over again."

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot extension playlist.
