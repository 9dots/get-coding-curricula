<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 9 students are introduced to the concept of debugging. Students use the stepping skills practiced in a previous lesson to find and remove unwanted lines of code.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can find and remove a bug in a 2-5 line sequence of code.

## 1. Engage: What is a Bug? (10 min)
**Location:** Rug
- [ ] **Read** the story of the first bug.
<iconp type='question'>Why was it important for the computer scientists not to give up?</iconp>

- [ ] **Define** bug and debugging.
>> "A bug is an error found in code. Debugging is what we do when we find and fix bugs in our code."

- [ ] **Explain** the importance of debugging.
>> "Bugs happen all of the time when we code. Even the best coders in the world have bugs in their code. That means that to become good coders we have to be good at debugging. The most important thing to remember when we debug is not to give up just like the computer scientists didn't give up in the story."

- [ ] **Introduce** students to the first debugging challenge in the playlist.
>>"In our first challenge today our PixelBot is supposed to paint the square above it. This challenge already has code. When I run the code it paints the wrong square. That means it has a bug in it.

- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge One as a class.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about this challenge?**</iconp>

Follow Up Questions
<iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>

- [ ] **Reveal** the bug to students by running the code.

<iconp type='question'>What did the PixelBot do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What was the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to help you fix the code without deleting the entire sequence. Use the questions below to prompt students as they help you debug the code. Try out student ideas on your computer as they share out. When necessary, step through the code using the yellow stepper button to help students identify the bug.
>>"It looks like this code has a bug because it didn't do what we wanted it to do. Your challenge is to help me debug the code without deleting all of the code and starting all over again."

<iconp type='question'>What did the PixelBot do that was wrong?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Where do you think the bug is in the code? What makes you think that?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What should we try to do to fix it?</iconp>

- [ ] **Explain** that the bug you found was an extra line of code that didn't belong where it was. Tell students that each challenge they will encounter in this lesson has a bug that is an extra line of code that needs to be removed.
>>"In our first challenge the PixelBot took an extra step that made it paint the wrong square. All of our challenges today have bugs that need to be removed. In each challenge there is one block of code that makes the PixelBot do the wrong thing. We have to find the block of code and delete it to debug the code."

## 2. Explain: Debugging (8 min)
**Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge Two as a class.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about this challenge?**</iconp>

Follow Up Questions
<iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>

- [ ] **Reveal** the bug to students by running the code.

<iconp type='question'>What did the PixelBot do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What was the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>."

- [ ] **Model** debugging challenge 2 in the playlist by using the stepper tool to find the extra line of code.
>>"This code is supposed to make the PixelBot paint 1 square to the right. When I run the code the PixelBot paints a square above the one it is supposed to paint. I can reset my PixelBot and use the yellow stepper button to step through my code one line at a time. It looks like each step works but there is an extra up block that we do not need before the paint block. If I delete that line and run the code the PixelBot paints the correct block."

## 3. Elaborate/Evaluate: PixelBot Playlist (12 min)
**Location:** Desks
- [ ] **Challenge** the class to debug the code in the playlist by removing only the extra lines of code.
>>"Your challenge is to debug the code in each challenge by only deleting the line of code that is not needed. You should not delete all of the code and start over again."

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot extension playlist.
