## 1. Engage: Observations (5 min)
**Location:** Rug
- [ ] **Introduce** the first debugging challenge of the day.
>> "Alright coders, today we are going to practice writing code with loops! Our first challenge of the day is on the board. Take the next 20 seconds to do your best to observe the grid, PixelBot and code."

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge as a class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What else do you notice?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What code blocks do you see?</iconp>

<note> By the end of this activity students should be aware of the:
  - goal of the challenge
  - position of the PixelBot
  - code blocks available</note>

## 2. Explore: Try It Out (2 min)
**Location:** Desks
- [ ] **Challenge** the class to complete challenge number 1.

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students try completing challenge number 1.

## 3. Explain: Writing Loops (5 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have students share out the strategies they used to solve the challenge.

<iconp type='question'>What did you do to solve this challenge?</iconp>

- [ ] **Model** solving challenge number 1.

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge 2 as a class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>

Follow up questions:
  <iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What else do you notice?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What code blocks do you see?</iconp>

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to complete challenge 2 and the rest of the PixelBot playlist.

## 4. Elaborate/Evaluate: PixelBot Practice (18 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot extension playlist.
