## 1. Practice (25 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Introduce** the lesson.
>>"In today's lesson we are going to practice all of the new coding skills we have learned! Next week will take our first Independent Coding Challenge where you will get to show off all of the new things you have learned. Today is our chance to practice."

- [ ] **Explain** that the class will be doing a mixture of reading, writing, and debugging challenges. Then show students how to identify the type of challenge in the playlist.
>>"Our playlist today will include reading, writing, and debugging challenges. When we start a challenge, we should always look at the picture in the corner to know what we should do in the challenge. When we see the yellow book it means that we will read the code and make our PixelBot move using the buttons below. When we see the blue pencil and paper it means that we will write code to solve the challenge and when we see the red square with the bug inside it means we will have to debug the code we are given."

- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students work through the review playlist independently.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional help. Student progress may be monitored through [schools.pixelbots.io][pixelbots].

<note type='tip'>If necessary, pull small groups of students in need of additional assistance to work through the challenges with you.</note>

## 2. Reflect (5 min)
**Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Reflect:** Students reflect on how they feel about coding class.
