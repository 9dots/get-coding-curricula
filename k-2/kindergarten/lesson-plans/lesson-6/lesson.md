<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 6, students learn to how to use commands to control the actions of a PixelBot. Students then apply this skill to write 2-5 line sequences of code.

## 1. Engage/Explore: Unpack and Code (10 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** challenge 1 from the practice playlist.
>>"Today we will all become coders! We will write our own code for the first time! In our challenges today we will code a robot to paint pictures for us. Here is our first challenge."

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge as a class.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about the challenge on the board?**</iconp>
    <iconp type='question'>Where is the PixelBot on the grid?</iconp>
    <iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing?</iconp>

- [ ] **Explain** the goal of the challenge.
>>"Our goal in this challenge is to get the PixelBot to paint the colored square black. The square that needs to be painted is above the PixelBot. The PixelBot has to move up and then paint to complete the challenge."

- [ ] **Think-Pair-Share** with the question below.

<iconp type='question'>Which of the code blocks on the board will get my PixelBot to move up?</iconp>

- [ ] **Model** writing and running code in the PixelBot editor in.
>>"First, my PixelBot needs to move to the square above it. The yellow arrow block tells the PixelBot to move up, so I will add it to my code by clicking it. Next, my PixelBot has to paint. The blue block here tells the PixelBot to paint, so I will add it to my code by clicking it. Now my code tells the PixelBot to move and then paint. To make my PixelBot act out my code I am going to click the green button below the grid."

- [ ] **Review** writing and running code in the editor.
>>"To add code we simply click the code blocks we want to add in order. Then we click the green button to make the PixelBot do what we have coded."

## 2. Explain: Guided PixelBot Practice (8 min)
- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge 2 as a class.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about the challenge on the board?**</iconp>
    <iconp type='question'>Where is the PixelBot on the grid?</iconp>
    <iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing?</iconp>
    <iconp type='question'>Which square does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
    <iconp type='question'>Which way should the PixelBot move?</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out and Model** Have student share out their answers to the question below. Test their ideas by adding code in the editor clicking run.

<iconp type='question'>What should the PixelBot do first?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which code block should I use to make the PixelBot move right?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What should the PixelBot do last?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which code block should I use to make the PixelBot paint?</iconp>

- [ ] **Explain** how to delete code.
>>"There will be times that we make mistakes in our code, but that's ok. Even the best coders in the world make mistakes. If you click the wrong code block, you will you have to delete it so that your PixelBot doesn't get confused. To delete a block of code you can click the little trash can on the right to throw it away."

- [ ] **Model** adding and deleting a code block in the editor.

## 3. Elaborate/Evaluate: PixelBot Practice (12 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot extension playlist.
