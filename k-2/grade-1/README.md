| Title             | Description        | Objectives |
| ------------------|--------------------| -----------|
|[Lesson 01: Move Forward and Turn](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14lrCU5BHW6BbTqfSkd9BJXk60CwQI1uXUDSmwETQ-xQ)|In the introductory lesson to the first grade curriculum, coders build on prior knowledge of navigating PixelBots in order to solve challenges with turns and forward moves. Students explore this new change and the code behind it, as well as the reasoning behind why navigational turns and forward moves are more realistic than simple directional moves. This is done by making real-life connections. This lesson serves to refresh students on the Kindergarten curricular themes and prepares them to move forward on to first grade.|I can write a PixelBot program with turns and forward moves.|
|[Lesson 02: Multiple Solutions](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X9WrjHhupnZG1lJJsNP3FIlx-vNaFhHI-Ls4yX8XPkY)|Where the last lesson gave students a new method for navigating the grid, Lesson 2 advances on this knowledge by prompting students to plan and execute multiple ways to solve the same challenge. The lesson begins with unplugged, real-world examples getting students to navigate the PixelBot to school, then moves on to partner and whole-class discourse around different methods to solve, and ends with plenty of student practice on PixelBots.|I can write more than one solution to solve a challenge.|
|[Lesson 03: Step it Up](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GCV4QVSaqXoNhMyq_xvpw2XA2sZXwTb-_NF_GwEdru0)|Lesson 3 builds on lesson 2 by introducing the skill of reading code with navigational turns. In the previous year’s curriculum, students were taught how to step through code with loops. This lesson gives students time and activities to practice both reading and using navigational turns within the grid. Build excitement for the lesson through the Engage and Explore sections of the lesson, and emphasize precision throughout the students’ work with PixelBots.|I can step through a sequence of code.|
|[Lesson 04: Bug Detectors](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1auvVBmVJw39w-BMi7fjio8JwZfF0Joo8h2pL-PfRyA0)|In lesson 4 students are reintroduced to debugging by finding and fixing a specific type of bug in the form of extra lines of code.|I can fix a bug by removing an extra line of code.|
|[Lesson 05: Bug Catchers](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Gfh0j9pC4LriEAYjH92Qlq-s5cTCKZoJKJEG4jaPCjc)|In Lesson 5, students move on from deleting unwanted lines of code to adding in missing code to solve their challenges. This lesson helps to build categories of types of bugs for students as they advance in their debugging capabilities.|I can fix a bug by adding a line of missing code.|
|[Lesson 06: Bug Out](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1th8z0Dqsp0vH5bzCWhdzGEFXBTtzGiRGYtpfcacWScI)|In Lesson 6, coders put together the knowledge from the past two lessons to tackle two-step bugs (deleting and adding code, or replacing code). This lesson aims to organically show coders how to target and fix the bugs in the code by repeatedly checking it.|I can fix  two-step bugs in my code.|
|[Lesson 07: Step Through the Loop](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ry8CfYbRO2RZszuYxgo1m5QLEIMFxgSDPM-sL9gYr40)|Students review how to step through loops in this lesson. The major change from the previous year’s curriculum is the use of navigational turns within loops. This lesson provides the foundation for the subsequent two lessons, which will shift into writing loops. Use this time to review the functionality of loops and why we use them as good coders.|I can step through a loop.|
|[Lesson 08: Loops](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WJnUSKu_C55L4fntZKxUDT1Xpoqrdx3ljzBdT_sK6zE)|In Lesson 8, students continue their work with loops by refactoring code to make it shorter and still achieve the same goal as the starter code. Students will first be asked to identify the core in a pattern, then rewrite the start code to include a loop. Use this lesson to reinforce key points regarding loops and encourage students to make their code shorter and easier to read.|I can rewrite a sequence of code with a loop.|
|[Lesson 09: Loops II](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PgNLsp0UQl0lGbJBVQGp6je0Ku09sL0TsAe4sL1K5oM)|In Lesson 9, students begin writing their own loops. They will need to take a look at the target grid (the grid with the final goal on the left) in each challenge and think through the core of the pattern that emerges, and then write a loop accordingly. Use the knowledge gained from Lesson 8 as a foundation for what students are asked to do in this lesson.|I can write a program containing a loop to solve a challenge.|
|[Lesson 10: Bug Catchers II](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rY11AKXNbmWOvd932sjZrgIWLnLfa5V8WtovDGN7Hig)|This lesson takes students’ prior knowledge about types of bugs (unwanted code, missing code, two-step bugs) and combines it with what they have learned about loops. This lesson specifically focuses just on bugs of unwanted code and bugs that are caused when a loop doesn’t run the correct amount of times. Lesson 11 will add on bugs with missing code.|I can debug a loop with repeat bugs. I can debug a loop with unwanted code.|
|[Lesson 11: Bug Catchers III](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HXXKU5wu3v9BzJHI_hk_BfHuB35sqljzwdhvJ5cBlzk)|Lesson 11 is an extension of Lesson 10 in that it adds on a new type of bug: Missing Code Bugs. Students will examine different loops within PixelBots to find the code that is missing and insert it into the editor. Students will also be given opportunities to review Repeat Bugs, or bugs where the loop does not repeat the correct amount of times.|I can debug a loop with repeat bugs. I can debug a loop with missing code.|
|[Lesson 12: Review](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gPKfRAiVRvXgArAI0yA1jkaTxwyAuX35M6qJHUphpUI)|In Lesson 12, students prepare for their Independent Coding Challenge in the next lesson by reviewing all of the skills that they have previously covered. This lesson serves as an opportunity for teachers to target specific students who need additional support, as the majority of the lesson is spent on working on PixelBots.|All objectives from lessons 1-11.|
|[Lesson 13: Independent Coding Challenge I](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UyV6VdDSpipKirugNtchASZuAX4mJr2YWrsUak8zk4U)|In this lesson, students put together everything they have learned about coding so far into the Independent Coding Challenge. This lesson is devoted mostly to independent work, with a short introduction and debrief at the beginning and end, respectively.|All objectives from lessons 1-11.|
|[Lesson 14: More Loops](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17Yofk_LdgUsNBK2S-mh1kYsgXw1GNd-9ecdjmm6ZIrk)|In lessons prior to the Independent Coding Challenge, students received instruction on reading loops, writing loops, and debugging loops. These lessons focused on code that included only loops. This next lesson moves forward by introducing code outside of loops to show students how to read longer strings of code including reading loops sequentially.|I can step through a program that contains code outside of a loop.|
|[Lesson 15: Loop and Loop Again](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QzyVnOByg-_TFYWI3MzdtKUQEbpv8hdivAHULZIQIgM)|Where Lesson 14 teaches students how to read code with and without loops, Lesson 15 pushes students to write similar code. The basis of this skill is in identifying which part of a target grid needs a loop and which part does not by finding regular patterns and outliers. Remind students to use what they know about patterns and loops to build their code.|I can write a program that contains code outside of a loop.|
|[Lesson 16: Loop and Loop Again II](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BPPfbzIvP4EhVUUR5qAAxxEQIMFpHN-wcSwCC5Ced-4)|Lesson 16 is a continuation of Lesson 15 as students gain comfort with coding more complex target grids. This lesson serves to provide more practice for coding programs with code inside and outside of loops. Students will be pushed to explain their reasoning for when they do and don’t use loops. They will also be asked to decompose each grid into distinct parts.|I can write a program that contains code outside of a loop. I can share out my reasoning for chunking code.|
|[Lesson 17: Multiple Solutions II](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OEzNb2ZjgiA9xz78J2WNWWlSkQFoJqZ76S7vi_u9MaY)|In this lesson, students will be using all of the skills they have learned throughout their year in getCoding to come up with multiple solutions for one complex target grid. Allow for thorough student exploration in this lesson and guide students toward explaining their thinking behind their code thoroughly.|I can solve a challenge with more than one solution.|
|[Lesson 18: Decompose and Code](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_cez2AK57eJKP05ijDkYYPs4Lph2BxyyFjarN1EkSyM)|Lesson 18 brings together what students have learned about decomposing images and creating multiple solutions in one. Remind students to be thoughtful in how they explain their plans before coding and their thought process after coding.|I can solve a challenge with more than one solution. I can decompose an image and code it one piece at a time.|
|[Lesson 19: Multiple Loops](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Lo0HF07PR3RKYVRfINvUHyHN5syCR0CWG2h8od33HZw)|Students, by this point, should have strong familiarity with loops and how to execute them. This lesson signals a last step in the sequence, as students are finally introduced to code with two separate loops. Students will need to read carefully as they step through code that is both inside and outside of loops.|I can step through a program that contains more than one loop.|
|[Lesson 20: Multiple Solutions III](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zI0Qhrq-YcUxLmGahyBBisBC-XgtssoaCSpjyw9jlqQ)|As students transition from learning new skills into the review, Independent Coding Challenge, and making a culminating project, they will have one last Multiple Solutions lesson to put together all of the skills they have learned so far. In this lesson, push students to use all of the tools in their toolbox to solve complex challenges.|I can solve a challenge with more than one solution.|
|[Lesson 21: Review](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pUksWAyIWhZ4MuGrzsoQnnQvuloA8VoR9r1oMO0i3fk)|Lesson 21 is the last review of all the skills coders have learned up to this point before the final Independent Coding Challenge (ICC) and final project. Use this time to cement crucial skills, like reading sequences, decomposing the grid to find patterns, and debugging.|All objectives from lessons 1-20.|
