<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In Lesson 6, coders put together the knowledge from the past two lessons to tackle two-step bugs (deleting and adding code, or replacing code). This lesson aims to organically show coders how to target and fix the bugs in the code by repeatedly checking it.


<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can fix  two-step bugs in my code.

- **Bug:** An error in code.
- **Debugging:** Finding and fixing errors in code.

## 1. Engage: Unpacking (8 mins)
**Location:** Rug

- **Introduce** the first challenge of the day.
>>“Coders, our first challenge of the day is on the board. Take the next 20 seconds to do your best to observe the grid, the PixelBot, and the code.”

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge as a class.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about this challenge?**</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What color does it need to paint the square?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing? (up, down, left, right)</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Is the PixelBot facing the square it needs to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What else do you notice?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>

<note type='tip'>By the end of this activity students should be aware of the:
  - goal of the challenge
  - position of the PixelBot
  - orientation of the PixelBot
  - presence of starter code</note>

- [ ] **Write** student observations on the board in order to validate student responses.
  Ex: “The penguin starts near the bottom facing left”, “The penguin needs to paint one square”, “The code doesn’t have a paint block”, etc.

<note type='tip'>As students are making observations, validate their answers with a “Thank you” or nod of the head to avoid evaluating with “Correct” or “Incorrect”. This helps to make students feel comfortable with contributing while still refraining from validating just one way of thinking or solution.</note>

## 2. Explore: Try It Out (2 mins)
- [ ] **Challenge** the class to fix the code without deleting everything and rewriting it.
>>“Your challenge in this activity is to fix the code by only changing the part that doesn’t work. You should not delete all of the code and rewrite it.”

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students attempt to debug the code on their own.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class to find students that can be called on to share their strategies in the next activity. Strategies include using the stepper tool (yellow button), inserting code instead of completely rewriting it, playing the code to see what happens first, planning out the code in the air, etc.

## 3. Explain: Debugging (12 mins)
- [ ] **Challenge** students to share out what was different about today’s lesson and bugs.

<iconp type='question'>Did you notice anything different about the bugs today?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We had to delete and add code to fix our bugs today.</iconp>

- [ ] **Think, Pair, Share:** Students share their responses to the questions below with a partner. After each partner has shared, call on students to share with the rest of the class.

<iconp type='question'>What changes did you make?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How did you know to make those changes?</iconp>

- [ ] **Review** the last two lessons’ and this lesson’s objective to help build categories of types of bugs.

<iconp type='question'>What are two types of bugs we have learned about?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We have learned about bugs with unwanted code, and bugs with missing code.</iconp>

>>“You already know what debugging is. During the past two weeks, we’ve learned about how to fix bugs in one step. But sometimes adding or deleting code is not enough, and we have to add and delete code to fix a bug.”

- [ ] **Define** two-step bugs as bugs where coders need to take two steps to fix the bug, like deleting and adding lines of code.

- [ ] **Introduce** challenge number two.
>>“The challenges we work on today will have code that will require two steps to fix. Here is our second challenge today. Take the next 20 seconds to observe the grid, PixelBot and the code.”

- [ ] **Unpack** challenge number two as a class.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about this challenge?**</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What color does it need to paint the square?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Is the PixelBot facing the square it needs to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What else do you notice?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>

- [ ] **Model** debugging PixelBot challenge number two by using the stepper tool.
>>“When I see this challenge, I notice that the penguin needs to move to the left one square and paint it black. But when I play the code as it is, I see that the code says that it’s going to turn right and paint instead! I need to get rid of the code in Line 1 by clicking the little trash can next to it first. Then, I need to double check that my white blinking line is where I want it - before the step forward block - and then add my turn right block in Line 1. Last, I’ll press play to check that it works.”

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBot Practice (20 mins)
- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.
- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.
- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot bonus playlist.

<note type='tip'>As students gain comfort with the skill, consider pulling a small group of students who need extra support. Use this time to provide extra guidance and solidify understanding.</note>

## 5. Evaluate: Debrief (5 mins)
-  [ ] **Discuss** the question below as a class.

<iconp type='question'>Why is it important to always check your code when debugging?</iconp>
