<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In Lesson 5, students move on from deleting unwanted lines of code to adding in missing code to solve their challenges. This lesson helps to build categories of types of bugs for students as they advance in their debugging capabilities.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can fix a bug by adding a line of missing code.

## 1. Engage: Unpacking (8 mins)
- **Introduce** the first challenge of the day.
>>“Coders, our first challenge of the day is on the board. Take the next 20 seconds to do your best to observe the grid, the PixelBot, and the code.”

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge as a class.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about this challenge?**</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What color does it need to paint the square?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing? (up, down, left, right)</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Is the PixelBot facing the square it needs to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What else do you notice?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>

<note type='tip'>By the end of this activity students should be aware of the:
  - goal of the challenge
  - position of the PixelBot
  - orientation of the PixelBot
  - presence of starter code</note>

## 2. Explore: Try It Out (2 mins)
- [ ] **Challenge** the class to fix the code without deleting everything and rewriting it.
>>“Your challenge in this activity is to fix the code by only changing the part that doesn’t work. You should not delete all of the code and rewrite it.”

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students attempt to debug the code on their own.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class to find students that can be called on to share their strategies in the next activity. Strategies include using the stepper tool (yellow button), inserting code instead of completely rewriting it, playing the code to see what happens first, planning out the code in the air, etc.

## 3. Explain: Debugging (12 mins)
- [ ] **Think, Pair, Share:** Students share their responses to the questions below with a partner. After each partner has shared, call on students to share with the rest of the class.

<iconp type='question'>What changes did you make?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How did you know to make those changes?</iconp>

- [ ] **Review** the last lesson’s and this lesson’s objective to help build categories of types of bugs.
>>“You already know what debugging is, since last week we learned about how to get rid of unwanted code. Today, we’re taking a good look at how to add code in a sequence that is missing a line. We debugged challenge one by adding a paint block to the very end so that the PixelBot could match the target grid.”

- [ ] **Introduce** challenge number two.
>>“The challenges we work on today will have missing code that we need to add in the correct spot. Here is our second challenge today. Take the next 20 seconds to observe the grid, PixelBot and the code.”

- [ ] **Unpack** challenge number two as a class.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about this challenge?**</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What color does it need to paint the square?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Is the PixelBot facing the square it needs to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What else do you notice?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>

- [ ] **Model** debugging PixelBot challenge number two by using the stepper tool.
>>“When I see this challenge, I notice that there are two blocks painted on the grid, but only one paint block. This could be my first hint that something is missing. To find where the problem is I can use the stepper tool. Each time I click the stepper tool the PixelBot acts out the next line of code. As I step through I see that everything is good, except I haven’t painted the second block. I will add a paint block to my code at the end, after line four. Line five will be my paint block.”

- [ ] **Explain** clearly how to add code by using the white blinking line.
>>“Students, you can see that we have to be careful when we add code. You have to move your cursor to the place between code where you’d like to add it. You will know where your code is going based on the blinking white line.”

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBot Practice (20 mins)
- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot bonus playlist.

<note type='tip'>Check challenges 3 and 4 in the practice playlist to track student progress.</note>

## 5. Evaluate: Debrief (5 mins)
- [ ] **Discuss** the question below as a class.

  <iconp type='question'>Why is it better to fix code than to delete everything and start over?</iconp>
