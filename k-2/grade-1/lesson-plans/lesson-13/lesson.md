<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In Lesson 13, students put together everything they have learned about coding so far into the Independent Coding Challenge. This lesson is devoted mostly to independent work, with a short introduction and debrief at the beginning and end, respectively.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>

- **Bug:** An error in code.
- **Debugging:** Finding and fixing errors in code.
- **Loop:** A sequence of actions that is repeated.
- **Starter code:** Code you build on to improve a program.
- **Pattern:** A sequence that repeats more than once.
- **Core:** The base sequence of a pattern that is repeated in a loop.
- **Refactoring:**  Rewriting code to make it easier to read, like by adding a loop.

## 1. Engage: Introducing the Challenge (6 mins)
**Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Challenge** students to use what they know to solve the Independent Coding Challenge.
>>“Today is an exciting day! Last week you had a chance to strengthen all your coding superpowers.
I noticed that all of you were paying attention to the type of challenge you were coding and followed the correct steps to solve them. Today you get to use those super strong powers to complete an Independent Coding Challenge.”

- [ ] **Motivate** students by watching a video of another young coder.
>>“Before we get started, I want to show you a video of a coder who is seven years old and made her own video game already! Being able to code is just like having a superpower because you can create something out of nothing! Are you ready to show off your coding superpowers today?"

<note type='tip'>The introduction is designed to be a very quick motivation for the Independent Coding Challenge. If you feel it is necessary, you may skip over the video and move directly into how to identify the type of challenge students are working on.
</note>
<br/>

## 2. Explore: Independent Coding Challenge (34 mins)
**Location:** Desks
<br/>
- [ ] **Explain**  how to identify the type of challenge in the playlist. Use the corresponding slide to show students where they can look to identify if it is a read, write, or debug challenge.

<iconp type='question'>**What does a reading challenge show in the corner? A writing challenge? A debugging challenge?**</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>A reading challenge shows a yellow book. A writing challenge shows a blue pencil and paper. A debugging challenge shows a red bug!</iconp>

<note type='tip'>This lesson is similarly structured as the previous week’s lesson with three different sections, each one for a different skill. Use the suggested times as a guide, but don’t feel beholden to them.
</note>
<br/>

**PART ONE:** Reading Code

*(Suggested Time: 9 minutes)*
<br/>
- [ ] **Review** how to complete reading challenges with students.

>>“Coders, the first type of challenge that we have learned how to do is reading code. Let’s remind ourselves how to complete reading code challenges (have students read from the slide):

- There is no goal for the PixelBot to paint.
- Read the code top to bottom.
- Use the controls below the grid to walk through the code.
<br/>
<note type='tip'>
If students need a brain break throughout the Independent Coding Challenge, use your judgement to implement a five-minute break halfway through the challenge. For example, you might have a stretch break or quick game of Simon Says.
</note>

>>“In this part of the lesson, you must read the code and step through it using the buttons below the grid. You are only completing Challenge One and Two.”

<br/>
- [ ] **Independent Practice** Release students to complete Challenges One and Two independently.

<br/>
<note type='tip'>
TIP: If students need dividers to keep from letting their eyes stray, feel free to put them up during independent work time.
</note>

**PART TWO:** Writing Code

*(Suggested Time: 9 minutes)*
<br/>
- [ ] **Review** how to complete writing challenges with students.

>>“Coders, the second type of challenge that we have learned how to do is writing code. Let’s remind ourselves how to complete writing code challenges (have students read from the slide):

- There is no code already written for you.
- Look at the goal to see what you need to paint.
- Use the code blocks to write code, and press play.

>>“Your next two challenges will be all about writing code!”

<br/>
- [ ] **Explain** to students how to go back to the challenge if they finish early.
>>“If you ever need to go back to see the whole playlist, you can always click the challenge name at the top left. In this case, you would click 1st Grade ICC 1 and it will show you all the challenges.”

<note type='tip'>
TIP: Feel free to pull small groups during independent practice to support students in tackling each skill type.
</note>

- [ ]**Independent Practice:** Release students to complete Challenges Three and Four independently.

**PART THREE:** Debugging Code

*(Suggested Time: 16 minutes)*
<br/>
- [ ] **Review** how to complete debugging challenges with students.

>>“Coders, the last type of challenge that we have learned how to do is debugging code. Let’s remind ourselves how to complete debugging code challenges (have students read from the slide):

- There is code already written for you with a bug in it.
- Use the yellow stepper tool to go through code one step at a time.
- Add code, delete code, or replace code.

>>“Your next four challenges will be all about debugging code! You may see all types of bugs in your playlist, and it’s your job to figure out the best way to solve each challenge.”

<br/>
<note type='tip'>
TIP: When students struggle, support them in the mechanics for completing a challenge, but do not support them in how to solve a challenge. For example, ask, “How do you add code to the editor?” as opposed to, “Which code block do you think you should add to the editor?”
</note>

- [ ]**Independent Practice:** Release students to complete Challenges Five through Eight independently. Use the following questions for challenges if students are stuck:
- **Reading**
 <iconp type='question'>**What is the first line of code? The second? The third?**</iconp>
 <iconp type='question'>**Is there a loop in the code? How many times does it repeat?**</iconp>
- **Writing**
<iconp type='question'>**What is the goal of the challenge?**</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>**Where is the PixelBot starting? Where does it need to go?**</iconp>
- **Debugging**
<iconp type='question'>**Have you used the yellow stepper tool to go one step at a time?**</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>**Can you delete some code? Can you add code?**</iconp>

<br/>
- [ ]**Extension:** If students complete the ICC, they can go back to work on any of the bonus playlists from Lesson 1-11.

## 3. Evaluate:  Reflection (5 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Think-Pair-Share:** Students share their responses to the questions below with a partner. After each partner has shared, call on students to share with the rest of the class.

<iconp type='question'>How did you feel when you were coding today? Why?</iconp>

<iconp type='question'>What did you do today to keep coding even when you faced a challenge?</iconp>
