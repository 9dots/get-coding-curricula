<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Lesson 2 advances on the new way of navigating the grid by prompting students to plan and execute multiple ways to solve the same challenge. The lesson begins with an unplugged activity that gets students to identify multiple paths to complete a navigation challenge. Students transfer this skill to coding challenges on PixelBots in which they code multiple solutions for the same challenge.

## 1. Engage: Challenge Details (5 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** the lesson’s first challenge.
>>“Today, we’re going to take a look at a challenge to open up our lesson. It’s important that we can understand the challenge well enough to complete it, so listen closely to what you need to do.”

- [ ] **Read** the challenge out loud with students (on student worksheets and the slideshow):
>>Directions: Penguin PixelBot needs to go to school! She needs to be careful walking around. Can you find three different ways that Penguin can take to get from the start to school? Plan your paths first, then use three different colors to show Penguin how to get to school.

- [ ] **Check for understanding** by calling on a student.

<iconp type='question'>What do you need to do to solve the challenge correctly?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We need to find three ways to get PixelBot Penguin to school.</iconp>

## 2. Explore: Explore (5 min)
- [ ] **Model** planning one possible route for students.
>>“I think a good way for the Penguin to get to school is to turn right and up toward the school. I planned my route by first drawing with my finger, and then I drew a path in my blue pencil.”

- [ ] **Reveal** teacher model path for students. Allow students time to copy the path on their own maps.

- [ ] **Challenge** students to find another path independently.
>>“Now that I’ve found one way and we all have it on our maps, it’s your turn to figure out just one more way Penguin can get to school in a different color. Afterward, we’ll have a volunteer come up and draw their path on the board.”

<note type='tip'>Project the slide show on a whiteboard in order to allow students to draw their solutions on the board.</note>

- [ ] **Share Out** Have a student volunteer share his/her path with the class by coming to the board and drawing it.

<iconp type='question'>Who would like to show the new path they found?</iconp>

- [ ] **Challenge** students to find another path independently.
>>"Let's find a new path that is different from the ones we have have on the board."

- [ ] **Share Out** Have a student volunteer share his/her path with the class by coming to the board and drawing it.

<iconp type='question'>Who would like to show the new path they found?</iconp>

- [ ] **Discuss** solutions with students.

- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Have students discuss the question below with a partner.

<iconp type='question'>Are some paths better than others? Why?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Yes, some routes might be better. If you want to go somewhere quickly, you would want a short path.</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have student volunteers share out their responses with the class.

## 3. Explain: Multiple Solutions (10 min)
- [ ] **Explain** that problems can sometimes be solved with more than one solution.
>>“Great coders can find different solutions to solve the same problem. In our class today, we are going to try to more than one solution for our challenges."

- [ ] **Reveal** an example challenge on the board and discuss with students the ways in which it can be solved.

- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Have students discuss the question below.

<iconp type='question'>How might you solve the challenge?</iconp>

- [ ] **Model** how to complete challenge one in the playlist for students by playing the video in the slideshow.

## 4. Elaborate: One Challenge (20 min)
- [ ] **Challenge** students to complete the playlist independently.
>>“In our playlist today you’ll be looking for more than one solution to a challenge. As a class, we’re going to see just how many different types of solutions we can come up with, so be sure to get creative!”

- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Have students work on the playlist independently.

- [ ] **Prompt** students with the following questions while circulating:

<iconp type='question'>What can you do to solve this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What did you do to solve this challenge the first time? What can you differently this time?</iconp>

## 5. Evaluate: Exit Challenge (5 min)
- [ ] **Challenge** students to move through the exit ticket playlist while circulating.

- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Have students discuss the questions below.

<iconp type='question'>How do you begin to solve a new challenge as a coder?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Examples: I like to go from top to bottom, I like to go left to right, I like to go in random order, etc.</iconp>

<iconp type='question'>Why would it be important to find multiple solutions in coding?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>It would be important to find multiple solutions in coding because we might be able to find a better way to do something than we already thought.</iconp>
