<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Where the last lesson gave students a new method for navigating the grid, Lesson Two advances on this knowledge by prompting students to plan and execute multiple ways to solve the same challenge. The lesson begins with unplugged, real-world examples getting students to navigate the PixelBot to school, then moves on to partner and whole-class discourse around different methods to solve, and ends with plenty of student practice on PixelBots.

## 1. Engage: Challenge Details (5 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** the lesson’s first challenge.
>>“Today, we’re going to take a look at a challenge to open up our lesson. It’s important that we can understand the challenge well enough to complete it, so listen closely to what you need to do.”

- [ ] **Read** the challenge out loud with students (on student worksheets and the slideshow):
>>Directions: Penguin PixelBot needs to go to school! She needs to be careful walking around. Can you find three different ways that Penguin can take to get from the start to school? Plan your paths first, then use three different colors to show Penguin how to get to school.

- [ ] **Check for understanding** by calling on a student.

<iconp type='question'>What do you need to do to solve the challenge correctly?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We need to find three ways to get PixelBot Penguin to school.</iconp>

## 2. Explore: Explore (5 min)
- [ ] **Model** planning one possible route for students.
>>“Take a look at the map on the board. I thought a good way for the Penguin to go is to turn right and up toward the school. I planned my route by first drawing with my finger, and then I drew a path in my blue pencil.”

- [ ] **Reveal** teacher model path for students. Allow students time to copy the path on their own maps.

- [ ] **Challenge** students to find another path.
>>“Now that I’ve found one way and we all have it on our maps, it’s your turn to figure out just one more way Penguin can get to school in a different color. Afterward, we’ll have a volunteer come up and draw their path on the board.”

- [ ] **Motivate** students to find another path independently while circulating around the room. Afterward, share out another path by inviting a volunteer to come to the board to draw their path.

<iconp type='question'>Who had the same path? Who had a different path?</iconp>
>>“Coders, we have two paths now! Let’s see if you can come up with one more in a different color.”

- [ ] **Motivate** students to find another path independently while circulating around the room. Afterward, share out another path by inviting a volunteer to come to the board to draw their path.

- [ ] **Discuss** solutions with students.

- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Allow students to talk to partners about one path that they took and why.

<iconp type='question'>Choose one path that you drew. Why did you choose the path that you took? Use the sentence frame, “I think this is a good way to get to school because…”</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Push students to describe their route and justify why they chose to navigate the route in that way.</iconp>

<iconp type='question'>Who has a different solution that they used to get to school?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Push students to describe their route in relation to the icons, and have them describe using left and right.</iconp>

<iconp type='question'>Why might we want to take the long way to school? Why might we want to take a shorter way?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We might want to take a long way if there’s something in the way or if we need to drop something off. We might want to take a shorter way if we’re late or don’t need to do anything along the way.</iconp>

<iconp type='question'>Are some paths better than others? Why?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Yes, some routes might be better. If you want to go somewhere quickly, you would want a short path.</iconp>

## 3. Explain: Multiple Solutions (10 min)
- [ ] **Review** the last week’s objective with students.
>>“Coders! Last week was an exciting one for us as we get better and better at coding. Let’s think back to what you learned that was new.”

<iconp type='question'>What new skill did you add to your coder toolbox last week?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We can turn left and right with the PixelBot.</iconp>

- [ ] **Discuss** with students the utility of solving challenges in multiple different ways.
>>“Great coders will try multiple different ways to solve one challenge. Just like in real life and in other fields, being able to stretch your thinking is helpful for getting creative.”

- [ ] **Reveal** an example challenge on the board and discuss with students the ways in which it can be solved.

- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Have students discuss the question below.

<iconp type='question'>How might you solve the challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Allow for several student voices to share out multiple solutions to the challenge.</iconp>
>>“When solving your challenges, think about how you can solve: top to bottom! Left to right! And think about the shortest ways to solve as well. Let’s take a look at your PixelBots playlist now."

- [ ] **Model** how to complete challenge one in the challenge playlist for students by playing the video in the slideshow.

## 4. Elaborate: One Challenge (20 min)
- [ ] **Challenge** students to move through the main playlist independently.
>>“Coders, just like you did in your grid challenge, you are going to go through challenges on PixelBots. You’ll be looking for multiple solutions to each one. As a class, we’re going to see just how many different types of solutions you can come up with, so be sure to get creative!”

- [ ] **Prompt** students with the following questions while circulating:

<iconp type='question'>What do you need to do to solve this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How are you planning on solving this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many different ways could we write this program?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do you think is the best way and why?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Compare your first solution to your second solution. How are they the same? Different?</iconp>

## 5. Evaluate: Exit Challenge (5 min)
- [ ] **Challenge** students to move through the exit ticket playlist while circulating.

- [ ] **Motivate** the students to place the lesson in the larger context of coding and their daily lives through close-out questioning.

- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Have students discuss the question below.

<iconp type='question'>How do you begin to solve a new challenge as a coder?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Examples: I like to go from top to bottom, I like to go left to right, I like to go in random order, etc.</iconp>

>>“Coders, today we were able to stretch our brains and think in new ways by finding different solutions to the same challenge. Each of us can use this skill in coding, and in our daily lives outside of coding.”

<iconp type='question'>Why would it be important to find multiple solutions in coding?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>It would be important to find multiple solutions in coding because we might be able to find a better way to do something than we already thought.</iconp>
