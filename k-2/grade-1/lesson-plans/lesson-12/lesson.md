<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In Lesson 12, students prepare for their Independent Coding Challenge in the next lesson by reviewing all of the skills that they have previously covered. This lesson serves as an opportunity for teachers to target specific students who need additional support, as the majority of the lesson is spent on working on PixelBots.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>

- **Bug:** An error in code.
- **Debugging:** Finding and fixing errors in code.

- **Starter code:** Code you build on to improve a program.
- **Pattern:** A sequence that repeats more than once.
- **Core:** The base sequence of a pattern that is repeated in a loop.
- **Refactoring:**  Rewriting code to make it easier to read, like by adding a loop.

## 1. Engage: Review (4 mins)
**Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Introduce** today's lesson to the class.
>>“Coders, you have learned so much this year so far! We are going to use today as a review for all of the different skills that you have learned, because next class we will have an independent coding challenge. This will be the one and only practice day you will have for the next lesson!”

<iconp type='question'>**What has been your favorite thing that you have learned in coding class so far? What has been the most challenging?**</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Student answers will vary. If they are confused, they may choose from turning left and right; reading code; different types of bugs; refactoring loops; reading, writing, and debugging loops.</iconp>

<note type='tip'>Quickly move through the engage to allow students maximum time to work on PixelBots.
</note>
<br/>

## 2. Explore: PixelBots (36 mins)
**Location:** Desks
<br/>
- [ ] **Define** the three different types of challenges by having students read their descriptions.

- **Reading challenges:** Read the code line-by-line and act it out.
- **Writing challenges:** Look at the target grid and plan how to paint. Write the code and check it.
- **Debugging challenges:** Check the already-written code to find the bug. Fix it and check.
>>“We are going to begin our review day. But before you begin, I want to show you how you can find what type of challenge you are working on. (Point to the icon in the upper left-hand corner of each challenge.) I’ve noticed so many of you are looking closely at exactly what kinds of challenges you are completing, and those are practices good coders do!”

<note type='tip'>The Explore section of the lesson is split into three parts based on skills:

1. Students review how to complete reading challenges, and complete Challenges One and Two.
2. Students review how to complete writing challenges, and complete Challenges Three through Six.
3. Students review how to complete debugging challenges, and complete Challenges Seven through Ten.
</note>
<br/>

**PART ONE:** Reading Code

*(Suggested Time: 8 minutes)*
<br/>
- [ ] **Review** how to complete reading challenges with students.

>>“Coders, the first type of challenge that we have learned how to do is reading code. Let’s remind ourselves how to complete reading code challenges (have students read from the slide):

- There is no goal for the PixelBot to paint.
- Read the code top to bottom.
- Use the controls below the grid to walk through the code.

<note type='tip'>
Circulate heavily in this lesson and use the teacher PixelBots platform to both target student misconceptions and judge when to move on as the entire class progresses through the playlist.
</note>

>>“In this part of the lesson, you must read the code and step through it using the buttons below the grid. You are only completing Challenge One and Two.”

<br/>
- [ ] **Independent Practice** Release students to complete Challenges One and Two independently.

<note type='tip'>
TIP: When using the teacher computer to review skills on the board, consider having all students sit on a rug to hold their attention. Direct students to move back to computers once they are ready to proceed to independent work.
</note>

**PART TWO:** Writing Loops

*(Suggested Time: 14 minutes)*
<br/>
- [ ] **Review** how to complete writing challenges with students.
>>“Coders, the second type of challenge that we have learned how to do is writing code. Let’s remind ourselves how to complete writing code challenges (have students read from the slide):

- There is no code already written for you.
- Look at the goal to see what you need to paint.
- Use the code blocks to write code, and press play.
>>“Your next four challenges will be all about writing code! The last two will be writing loops. Let’s quickly review how to write loops so you can be prepared!”

- [ ] **Review** writing loops by looking ahead to Challenge Five.
>>“In Challenge Five, we see that we have a goal grid, which is blue and brown. Now, I could code this without a loop, but I see at the top of the grid that I must stay within seven lines of code, meaning I should likely use a loop.”

<note type='tip'>If a large portion of the class still struggles with writing loops in Challenge Six, review the challenge before moving on to the next portion of the lesson.
</note>
<iconp type='question'>Look at the pattern. What part repeats? How many times?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>The part that repeats is brown, blue. It repeats two times.</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ]**Guided practice:** Have students share out exactly how to code the pattern by calling out which blocks to write.
<iconp type='question'>Which block should I write first?
</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many times will the loop repeat?
</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What blocks should go inside the loop? Why?
</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What should we do once the loop is written?
</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Am I within the line limit?
</iconp>
<br/>

- [ ]**Independent Practice:** After reviewing Challenge Five, release students to complete Challenges Three through Six independently.

**PART THREE:** Debugging

*(Suggested Time: 10 minutes)*
<br/>
- [ ] **Review** how to complete debugging challenges with students.
>>“Coders, the last type of challenge that we have learned how to do is debugging code. Let’s remind ourselves how to complete debugging code challenges (have students read from the slide):

-  There is code already written for you with a bug in it.
- Use the yellow stepper tool to go through code one step at a time.
- Add code, delete code, or replace code.
>>“Your next four challenges will be all about debugging code! You may see all types of bugs in your playlist, and it’s your job to figure out the best way to solve each challenge. Let’s take a look at Challenge Seven for an example.”

- [ ]**Reveal** the bug in the Challenge by playing the code line-by-line using the yellow button.
- [ ]**Think-Pair-Share:** Students share their responses to the questions below with a partner. After each partner has shared, call on students to share with the rest of the class.
<iconp type='question'>What line is the bug on? What should we do?
</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>The bug is on line three! You need to delete the extra turn.
</iconp>
>>“Great job finding the bug! This time, we had unwanted code. But that might not be the case every time! Make sure to use the yellow stepper tool to read code line-by-line and find each bug.”

- [ ]**Independent Practice:** After reviewing Challenge Seven, release students to complete Challenges Seven through Ten independently.

## 3. Evaluate:  Reflection (5 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Think-Pair-Share:** Students share their responses to the questions below with a partner. After each partner has shared, call on students to share with the rest of the class.

<iconp type='question'>How did you feel while coding today and why? What did you learn today?</iconp>

<iconp type='question'>What skill do you think you’ve done really well on? What skill do you want to keep practicing?
</iconp>
