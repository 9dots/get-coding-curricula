<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lessons prior to the Independent Coding Challenge, students received instruction on reading loops, writing loops, and debugging loops. These lessons focused on code that included only loops. This next lesson moves forward by introducing code outside of loops to show students how to read longer strings of code including reading loops sequentially.

## 1. Engage: Introducing the Challenge (6 mins)
**Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Introduce** the first challenge of the day.
>>“Coders, our first challenge of the day is on the board. Take the next 20 seconds to to observe the grid, the PixelBot, and the code.”

- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge One as a class. Use the blank slide following the challenge to write down student observations.

<note type='tip'>
In the initial unpacking, aim to have students guide the conversation and answer all of the questions in the suggested list themselves, interjecting when necessary to guide them to the key points.

Possible student answers for unpacking:

- I see that there is a loop that repeats two times.
- I see that there is code inside the loop that tells us to step, then paint blue.
- I see that there is code outside of the loop that tells us to paint a different color.
- I see that the PixelBot is starting at the second from the bottom row.
- I see that the PixelBot is facing right.
- I see that we need to read code for this challenge. I know because there is a yellow box in the corner with a book, and there is code already there.

</note>
<br/>

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many blocks do you think the PixelBot will paint?</iconp>

Follow up questions:
For unpacking the starter code
<iconp type='question'>Is there a loop in the starter code? How many times does it repeat?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do you see any other code?</iconp>

For identifying the type of challenge coders need to complete
<iconp type='question'>What is our job as coders this time? How do you know?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>

For identifying the goal of the challenge:
<iconp type='question'>Is the PixelBot going to paint?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What color does it need to paint the squares?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing? (up, down, left, right)</iconp>

- [ ] **Discuss:** Prompt students to make a prediction about the order of events that will occur when they step through the code.
>>
“I notice that there are different parts to the starter code based on what you all told me while unpacking. Let’s take a moment to predict what will happen and in what order when you step through the code. Make sure to use what you already know about code to help you.


- [ ]**Think, Pair, Share:** Students share their responses to the questions below with a partner. After each partner has shared, call on students to share with the rest of the class.
<iconp type='question'>In what order will the code be completed? Why?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>First, we will paint blue, step, and turn left. Then, we complete the loop twice by stepping, painting black, then stepping, painting black.</iconp>
<note type='tip'>
If possible, make a connection to how students make predictions during English Language Arts in this portion of the lesson. The students here combine what they already know about code (prior knowledge) and what they see in the code (evidence from the “text”) and combine them to make a prediction.

## 2. Explore: Try It Out (4 mins)
**Location:** Rug/Desks
<br/>
- [ ] **Challenge** the class to step through the code in Challenge One.
>>“Today I want you to try Challenge One based on what we learned while unpacking as a class. Use what you know about loops to help you.”

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students attempt to debug Challenge One at computers.
- [ ] **Monitor** the class to find students who can be called on to share their strategies in the next activity. Look for students who are successfully completing the code outside the loop once and completing the loop the correct number of times.

## 3. Explain:  Code Outside of Loops (10 mins)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Debrief:** challenge one as a class.

<iconp type='question'>How was today’s code different from other times we’ve had loops?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We had code outside of the loop today!</iconp>

- [ ] **Think, Pair, Share:** Students share their responses to the questions below with a partner. After each partner has shared, call on students to share with the rest of the class.

<iconp type='question'>How did you step through Challenge One?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Student answers will vary.</iconp>

<note type='tip'>
In the slideshow, sentence starters are provided for students to use.

For example:

1. The first step I took was...Then I…
1. I repeated the loop _____ times because…
1. I repeated the code outside the loop ____ times because…
1. The challenging part was...The easy part was...
</note>
<br/>

- [ ] **Model** how to sequentially step through the code for Challenge One using the slideshow (arrows will show students which blocks to execute in which order).
>>“Coders, all code in PixelBots is going to be read sequentially, or top to bottom. For this challenge, I would step through the first three blocks as normal since there’s no loop around it. Then, I see there’s a loop underneath it. Once I enter the loop, I have to go back to the top block of the loop and repeat the code inside as many times as the loop tells me to. I can count on my fingers to keep track of how many times I’ve repeated the loop.”

- [ ]**Think, Pair, Share:** Students share their responses to the questions below with a partner. After each partner has shared, call on students to share with the rest of the class.

<iconp type='question'>Once we have entered a loop, how do we know that it’s time to exit the loop?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>You will know once you’ve completed the code inside the loop as many times as it says.
</iconp>

- [ ] **Reveal** the completed grid to students.

<iconp type='question'>How do you know which part of the grid repeats? How do you know which part doesn’t repeat?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>I know the black part repeats since there’s two blocks in order. The blue one is off to the side and alone, so it’s not in a loop.</iconp>

- [ ] **Introduce** Challenge Two.
>>“The challenges we work on today will be pretty similar to our first! Here is our second challenge today. Take the next 20 seconds to observe the grid, PixelBot and the code.”

- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge Two as a class. Use the blank slide following the challenge to write down student observations.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many blocks do you think the PixelBot will paint?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How is this challenge different from Challenge One?</iconp>

- [ ] **Discuss:** Prompt students to make a prediction about the order of events that will occur when they step through the code.

<iconp type='question'>In what order will the code be completed? Why?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>First, we will step through the loop three times. Then, we will exit the loop and paint, then step orange.</iconp>

- [ ] **Model** solving Challenge Two for students.
>>“I need to remember that the code we read on PixelBots is always read top to bottom. First, I will enter the loop and not leave until I’ve completed the code three times. I will step, paint green, and turn right three times. Then, after I’ve completed the loop, I will exit it and move on to the next code. Finally, I will step and paint orange just once at the bottom of the code.”

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBot Practice (18 mins)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.
- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance. If time permits, review challenges 4 and 5 with students by allowing them to share their coding process.
- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot bonus challenges.

<note type='tip'>
As students gain comfort with the skill, consider pulling a small group of students who need extra support. Use this time to provide extra guidance and solidify understanding.
</note>
<br/>

## 5. Evaluate. Debrief (5 mins)
**Location:** Desks
- [ ] **Discuss** the question below as a class.
<iconp type='question'>How did you feel while coding today and why?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What did you learn today?</iconp>

<note type='tip'>
The purpose of asking students how they feel when coding is to allow students to reflect on their learning process. Allowing students a safe space to express their ideas with each other and with the teacher helps validate their thinking and feelings. As the teacher, make sure that all students have a chance to share their thinking and feelings with the class throughout the year.
