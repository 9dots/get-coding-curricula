In lesson 4 students are reintroduced to debugging by finding and fixing a specific type of bug in the form of extra lines of code.

## 1. Engage: Unpacking (8 mins)
- **Introduce** the first challenge of the day.
>>“Alright coders, our first challenge of the day is on the board. Take the next 20 seconds to do your best to observe the grid, the PixelBot, and the code.”

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge as a class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What color does it need to paint the square?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing? (up, down, left, right)</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Is the PixelBot facing the square it needs to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What else do you notice?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>

<note type='tip'>The first question in the engage activity is meant to give students the opportunity to call out anything they notice about the challenge. The subsequent questions are follow-ups that are meant to guide students to make the types of relevant observations they should make every time they approach a challenge. By the end of this activity students should be aware of the:
  - goal of the challenge
  - position of the PixelBot
  - orientation of the PixelBot
  - presence of starter code</note>

## 2. Explore: Try It Out (2 mins)
- [ ] **Challenge** the class to fix the code without deleting everything and rewriting it.
>>“Your challenge in this activity is to fix the code by only changing the part that doesn’t work. You should not delete all of the code and rewrite it.”

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students attempt to debug the code on their own.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class to find students that can be called on to share their strategies in the next activity.

## 3. Explain: Debugging (12 mins)
- [ ] **Think, Pair, Share:** Students share their responses to the questions below with a partner. After each partner has shared, call on students to share with the rest of the class.

  <iconp type='question'>What changes did you make?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How did you know to make those changes?</iconp>

- [ ] **Review** what it means to debug code using the challenge students completed.
>>“Last year we learned that bugs are mistakes in our code and we fix them through a process we call debugging. We just debugged the code in challenge one by deleting the extra line of code that made the PixelBot paint the wrong square.”

- [ ] **Explain** that unwanted lines of code are a common bug in PixelBots.
>>“The challenges we will work on today each have a bug caused by an extra line of code. We need to find it and delete it”

- [ ] **Introduce** challenge number two.
>>“Here is our second challenge today. Take the next 20 seconds to observe the grid, PixelBot and the code.”

- [ ] **Unpack** challenge number two as a class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What color does it need to paint the square?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing? (up, down, left, right)</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Is the PixelBot facing the square it needs to paint?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What else do you notice?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>

- [ ] **Model** debugging PixelBot challenge number two by using the stepper tool.
>>“When I run this code it doesn’t paint the correct square. To find the problem I can use the stepper tool. Each time I click the stepper tool the PixelBot acts out the next line of code. As I continue to click the stepper tool I can see that line four in the code makes my PixelBot pass the square it was supposed to paint. That means line four is a bug and I will delete it. Now I can run my code and it paints the correct square.”

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBot Practice (20 mins)
- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.
- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.
- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot bonus playlist.

## 5. Evaluate: Debrief (5 mins)
- [ ] **Discuss** the question below as a class.

  <iconp type='question'>What was the most challenging part of debugging code today?</iconp>
