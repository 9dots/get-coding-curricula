<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In the introductory lesson, coders build on prior knowledge of navigating PixelBots to code with new commands. This lesson serves to refresh students on concepts covered in the kindergarten curriculum.

## 1. Engage: Being the PixelBot (5 min)
- [ ] **Demonstrate** to students how to distinguish between left and right from the point of view of the PixelBot in order to work through the upcoming playlists.
  >>“Coders, today we are going to learn something really exciting. You used PixelBots in Kindergarten and you were really good at moving the PixelBot from side to side. Now you're in first grade and there's a brand new way first graders move their PixelBots. Just like in real life, coders use left and right to direct characters on their screens to move.”

<iconp type='question'>Who can show me which hand is their left hand?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Who can show me which hand is their right?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Gauge student understanding through hand raising.</iconp>

- [ ] **Distribute** PixelBot Left/Right Tokens to students to scaffold their understanding of left and right.

- [ ] **Reveal** slides to walk students through how to justify their reasoning when asked questions about navigational turns.
  >>“Take a look at the PixelBot on the board. You can see that on her left I wrote the word, “Left”, and on her right I wrote the word, “Right.”

<note>![left-right](./images/engage-1.png)</note>

<iconp type='question'>If she turned this way, what do you think I told her to do? Turn right, or turn left?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Turn left!</iconp>

<iconp type='question'>If she turned this way, what do you think I told her to do? Turn right, or turn left?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Turn right!</iconp>

- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Students discuss the question below.

<iconp type='question'>If she turned this way, what do you think I told her to do? Turn right, or turn left? Turn and talk with your partner.</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Turn right!</iconp>

- [ ] **Challenge** students to use this new knowledge to lead the teacher (with a penguin backpack to represent the PixelBot) to navigate an obstacle challenge using the grid and obstacles. The teacher should hold the blue LEFT paper in their left hand and the red RIGHT paper in their right hand to help students understand that these directions change based on point of view.

## 2. Explore: Exploring PixelBots (5 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** the compare and contrast activity.
>>“Now that we have walked through how to guide real people through an obstacle course, let’s see how this connects to PixelBots. I’m going to show you a couple of images in my slideshow, and I want you to think through what you notice."

- [ ] **Reveal** the old way in which the PixelBot navigates through the grid, and project the new way side-by-side.

<iconp type='question'>What do you see?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How is the PixelBot on the left moving differently from the PixelBot on the right?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>On the left, I see that the PixelBot is just stepping to the side, but on the right, the PixelBot turns and then moves.</iconp>

<note>![explore](./images/explore-1.png)</note>

## 3. Explain: Learning the Moves (10 min)
- [ ] **Model** how to use the PixelBot token on the board to show the students that left and right change depending on where the Penguin is looking.

- [ ] **Demonstrate** the mechanics of how to navigate the PixelBot with turns. Afterward, use probing questions to cement student understanding:

<iconp type='question'>When you turn left or right, does the PixelBot move forward? Where does she move?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>No, she doesn’t move forward. She stays in place.</iconp>

<iconp type='question'>How do we know where the PixelBot’s left and right are?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We have to think like we’re looking through the PixelBot’s eyes!</iconp>

<note>![explain](./images/explain-1.png)</note>

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBots Playlist (20 min)
- [ ] **Model** how to use the PixelBot tokens with “L” and “R” using challenge number one in the playlist.
>>“These tokens can be helpful for you to know which way to go. Use the token either in your hand or held up against the screen to help you go left and right.”

- [ ] **Challenge** students to grapple with the navigational turns by going through their playlist after checking for student understanding. If students finish early, direct them to work through the extension playlist.

<note>![elaborate](./images/elaborate-1.png)</note>

## 5. Evaluate: Exit Challenge (5 min)
- [ ] **Motivate** students to reflect on their new skill as coders.
>> “Coders, today we took a big step forward and learned something new and important! Today, we learned about how to view our challenges through the point of view of the PixelBot and how to make left and right turns.”

<iconp type='question'>What part of coding class was the most challenging today?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>It was difficult to find the different turns that the PixelBot should be using in order to go through the grid.</iconp>
