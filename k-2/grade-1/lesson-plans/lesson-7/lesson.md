<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students review how to step through loops in this lesson. The major change from the previous year’s curriculum is the use of navigational turns within loops. This lesson provides the foundation for the subsequent two lessons, which will shift into writing loops. Use this time to review the functionality of loops and why we use them as good coders.

## 1. Engage: Unpacking (8 mins)
- [ ] **Introduce** the first challenge of the day.
>>“Coders, our first challenge of the day is on the board. Take the next 20 seconds to do your best to observe the grid, the PixelBot, and the code.”

<note type='tip'>By this point, students have been through the unpacking process three times in the preceding debugging lessons. Aim to have students guide the conversation and answer all of the questions in the suggested list themselves, interjecting when necessary to guide them to the key points.</note>

- [ ] **Unpack** the challenge as a class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do you think the code does?</iconp>

Follow up questions:

<iconp type='question'>What is our job as coders this time?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What color does it need to paint the squares?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing? (up, down, left, right)</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do you see anything different than before?</iconp>

- [ ] **Challenge** students to share out what is different about today’s challenge if they have not already done so.

<iconp type='question'>What new block did you notice we had to read today? What do you notice about the code blocks?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We have to read a loop block today.</iconp>

- [ ] **Write** student answers on the board to have all students see them, and to help validate answers.
Sample Answers: “This time we need to read the code instead of debug it”, “We have code that we need to follow”, “I see a loop block in the code”, etc.

## 2. Explore: Try It Out (2 mins)
- [ ] **Challenge** the class to step through the code with the loop accurately.
>>“Today I want you to try to find out what the code does. Your challenge in this activity is to step through the code that’s been written for you line-by-line and complete it correctly.”

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students attempt to step through the code on their own.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class to find students who can be called on to share their strategies in the next activity. Strategies might include counting on fingers to show how many times they’ve completed the loop, using the reset button to start over if necessary, checking with the blue check button, etc.

## 3. Explain: Try It With Loops (12 min)
- [ ] **Debrief** challenge one as a class.

<iconp type='question'>What did the start code do today?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>The code had us move and paint black four times in a row.</iconp>

- [ ] **Think, Pair, Share:** Students share their responses to the questions below with a partner. After each partner has shared, call on students to share with the rest of the class.

<iconp type='question'>What does a loop block tell us to do?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>A loop block tells us that we need to repeat the code inside the block.</iconp>

<iconp type='question'>How do we know how often we need to repeat?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We look at the number at the end of the loop block.</iconp>

- [ ] **Define** loops as a sequence of actions that are repeated.

- [ ] **Model** how to predict what a chunk of code will do for students.
>>“When I see a reading challenge, it’s always good to predict what I think it will do first. I will show you how I could do this for Challenge 1. First, I know that a loop block will tell me to repeat a chunk of code however many times it says in the first block. In the code, I see 1 paint block that repeats 4 times. So I think the completed grid will show 4 painted squares.”

<note type='tip'>If possible, make a connection to how students make predictions during English Language Arts to this portion of the lesson. The students here combine what they already know about code (prior knowledge) and what they see in the code (evidence from the “text”) and combine them to make a prediction.</note>

- [ ] **Introduce** challenge number two.
>>“The challenges we work on today will be pretty similar to our first one! Here is our second challenge today. Take the next 20 seconds to observe the grid, PixelBot and the code.”

- [ ] **Unpack** challenge number two as a class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What do you think the code does?</iconp>

Follow up questions:

<iconp type='question'>What is our job as coders this time?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What color does it need to paint the squares?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing? (up, down, left, right)</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do you see anything different than before?</iconp>

- [ ] **Think, Pair, Share:** Students share their responses to the questions below with a partner. After each partner has shared, call on students to share with the rest of the class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you predict will happen in this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Students share out predictions using what they already know and what they see in the code.</iconp>

- [ ] **Model** stepping through PixelBot challenge number two.
>>“When I look at this challenge, I see that it has a loop. The code inside the loop repeats two times. The first line tells me to paint the square my PixelBot is on. Then I have to step 2 times. Since my code is supposed to repeat two times, I have to step through the code one more time. My PixelBot paints and takes two steps.”

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBot Practice (18 mins)
- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot bonus playlist.

<note type='tip'>As students gain comfort with the skill, consider pulling a small group of students who need extra support. Use this time to provide extra guidance and solidify understanding.</note>

## 5. Evaluate:  Debrief (5 min)
- [ ] **Discuss** the question below as a class.

<iconp type='question'>Why do we use loops?</iconp>

<note type='tip'>Use the debrief question as an informal check to see which students can verbalize why good coders use loops, and which students need additional support in the next two lessons.</note>
