<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Lesson 11 is an extension of Lesson 10 in that it adds on a new type of bug: Missing Code Bugs. Students will examine different loops within PixelBots to find the code that is missing and insert it into the editor. Students will also be given opportunities to review Repeat Bugs, or bugs where the loop does not repeat the correct amount of times.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can debug a loop with Repeat Bugs.
- I can debug a loop with missing code.

- **Loop:** A sequence of actions that is repeated.
- **Bug:** An error in code.

## 1. Engage: Unpacking (8 mins)
**Location:** Rug

- [ ] **Introduce** the first challenge of the day.
>>“Coders, our first challenge of the day is on the board. Take the next 20 seconds to do your best to observe the grid, the PixelBot, and the code.”

- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge One as a class. Use the blank slide following the challenge to write down student observations.

<iconp type='question'>**What do you notice about this challenge?**</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>**How many blocks do you think the PixelBot will paint?**</iconp>
<br/>
Follow up questions:
<br/>
(For identifying the loop)
<iconp type='question'>Do you see a pattern? </iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is the core of the pattern?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Is there a loop?</iconp>
<br/>
(For identifying the type of challenge coders need to complete)
<iconp type='question'>What is our job as coders this time?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
<br/>
(For identifying the goal of the challenge)
<iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What color does it need to paint the squares?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing? (up, down, left, right)</iconp>
<br/>
<note type='tip'>Possible student answers for unpacking:

- I see that there is a loop that repeats two times.
- I see that there is code inside the loop that tells us to step, then paint.
- I see that the PixelBot is supposed to paint two squares at the bottom left of the grid.
- I see that the PixelBot is starting at the top.
- I see that the PixelBot is facing down.
- I see that we need to debug for this challenge.
</note>
<br/>
- [ ] **Reveal** the bug to students by running the code.

<iconp type='question'>How has running the starter code changed what you notice about the challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>I see that there is a bug because there is a missing step!</iconp>

## 2. Explore: Try It Out (4 mins)
**Location:** Rug/Desks

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to debug the loop in Challenge One.
>>“Today I want you to try Challenge One based on what we learned while unpacking as a class. Use what you know about loops and bugs to help you.”

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Have students attempt to debug Challenge One.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class to find students who can be called on to share their strategies in the next activity. Look for students who are using the yellow stepper tool to check their code line-by-line and students who check their work at the end by pressing play.

## 3. Explain: Debugging Loops (10 min)

- [ ] **Think, Pair, Share:** Students share their responses to the questions below with a partner. After each partner has shared, call on students to share with the rest of the class.

<iconp type='question'>What was the bug that you found in Challenge One? How did you fix it?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>There was a missing step. I fixed it by adding another step forward block.</iconp>
<br/>
- [ ] **Model** playing Challenge One with the error still in the code to have students name the type of bug that they are working with.

<iconp type='question'>Last week we had unwanted code. Do we still have unwanted code this week?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>No! This week we were missing code.</iconp>
<br/>
- [ ] **Review** the different types of bugs that students can debug.

<iconp type='question'>So far we’ve learned about many types of bugs. What are they?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Unwanted Code Bugs, Missing Code Bugs, Repeat Bugs, and Two-Step Bugs.</iconp>
<br/>
>>“When debugging loops, we’re not going to worry about Two-Step bugs. Today, we’re going to focus on Missing Code Bugs and Repeat Bugs.”
>>“You already have the tools to debug! Today, we are combining two skills: debugging, and using loops.”
<br/>
- [ ] **Review** how to add code for students.
>>“Last time we worked with Missing Code Bugs, we talk about how to add code in between lines. Remember that when we want to add code, we have to look for the blinking white line. This tells us where our new code will go.”

- [ ] **Introduce** Challenge Two.
>>“The challenges we work on today will be pretty similar to our first! Here is our second challenge today. Take the next 20 seconds to observe the grid, PixelBot and the code.”

- [ ] **Unpack** Challenge Two as a class.

<iconp type='question'>What do you notice about this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many blocks do you think the PixelBot will paint?</iconp>
<br/>
Follow up questions:
<br/>
(For identifying the loop)
<iconp type='question'>Do you see a pattern? </iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is the core of the pattern?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Is there a loop?</iconp>
<br/>
(For identifying the type of challenge coders need to complete)
<iconp type='question'>What is our job as coders this time?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Do we have code to begin with?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What is the PixelBot supposed to do?</iconp>
<br/>
(For identifying the goal of the challenge)
<iconp type='question'>How many squares does the PixelBot need to paint?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>What color does it need to paint the squares?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which way is the PixelBot facing? (up, down, left, right)</iconp>
<br/>
- [ ] **Reveal** the bug to students by running the code.

<iconp type='question'>How has running the starter code changed what you notice about the challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>I see that there is a bug because there is a missing paint block!</iconp>

- [ ] **Model** solving challenge three for students.
>>“First, I’m going to play my code to see what happens. When I play my code, I see that the loop plays the correct amount of times, but that it doesn’t paint the second square orange. I see that the code is step, paint brown, step. Second, I will click exactly where I want to add more code. I will click between line four and line five. Finally, I will add a paint block at the end and have it paint the square orange. When I play the code again, I see it’s perfect!”

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBot Practice (18 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students work through the rest of the challenges in the PixelBot playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance. If time permits, review
Challenges 4 and 5 with students by allowing them to share their coding process.

- [ ] **Extension:** Have students who finish early work on the PixelBot bonus playlist.

## 5. Evaluate:  Debrief (5 min)
**Location:** Desks

- [ ] **Discuss** the question below as a class.

<iconp type='question'>How did you feel while coding today and why? What did you learn today?</iconp>

<note type='tip'>This debrief question aims to show the teacher more about students’ comfort and enjoyment with debugging. The slideshow includes an array of emotions as a bank for students to choose from to support their answers to the debrief question. The purpose of asking students how they feel when coding is to allow students to reflect on their learning process. Allowing students a safe space to express their ideas with each other and with the teacher helps validate their thinking and feelings. As the teacher, make sure that all students have a chance to share their thinking and feelings with the class throughout the year.
