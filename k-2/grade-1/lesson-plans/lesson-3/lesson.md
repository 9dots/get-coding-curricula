## 1. Engage: Challenge (5 mins)
- [ ] **Challenge** students by outlining the lesson’s first activity.
>>“Just like how you do exciting things over the summer, so does Penguin! Let’s see what she did to find out about our first challenge for the day. This past summer, Penguin took a trip to a deserted island, and she found a treasure map! The treasure map leads her to just one treasure chest. Help her use the code on the right to see which treasure chest she found!"

<iconp type='question'>What do we need to do in this challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We need to read the code and find out which treasure chest Penguin found.</iconp>

## 2. Explore: Treasure Map (5 mins)
- [ ] **Expain** how the treasure map handout and Penguin Left/Right token should be used.
>>“While completing the challenge, use your token to show which way the PixelBot is turning and moving. When you complete one step, write a check mark next to the code block you read.”

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have students share their responses to the question below.

<iconp type='question'>Why might we want to check off each block?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We might check them off to show that we already used it. We don’t want to use the same block twice.</iconp>

- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Release students to work independently to complete the challenge. Circulate to ensure students are working with precision.

- [ ] **Share Out:** Have student volunteers share out the number of the treasure chest they think Penguin stopped on.

<iconp type='question'>Which treasure chest did Penguin stop on?</iconp>

- [ ] **Reveal** the correct answer to the class.

## 3. Explain: Stepping Through (5 mins)
- [ ] **Model** how to complete a reading challenge.
>>“Take a look at challenge one. You are going to follow the code blocks on the right to have the Penguin move and paint one block at a time. You can use the purple buttons on the bottom left to act out the movements and the green buttons to paint.”

- [ ] **Explain** how to use the buttons on PixelBots to complete the challenge by showing how to turn, move, and paint.
>>“This challenge asks me to first turn right, so I’ll click the purple turn right button to turn in the direction the block asks me to. Then, I’ll step forward by clicking on the purple move forward button. Finally, I’ll paint by clicking on the green paint button.”

- [ ] **Check for understanding** by having students answer the questions below.
<iconp type='question'>How do you turn? How do you move? How do you paint?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>You turn by pressing purple turn buttons. You move by clicking on the purple move forward button. You paint by clicking on the green paint button.</iconp>

## 4. Elaborate: PixelBot Practice (20 mins)
- [ ] **Challenge** students work through their playlist. If students finish early, direct them to work through the extension playlist.

- [ ] **Monitor** the room for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Review** challenges two and four whole group using the images in the slideshow.

## 5. Evaluate: Debrief (5 mins)
- [ ] **Debrief** the lesson.

- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Have students discuss the question below with a partner.

<iconp type='question'>What is challenging about reading challenges?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Student answers will vary.</iconp>
