#### 1. Engage: Debugging (5-10 minutes)

- [ ] **Debugging:** Review and read the Debugging Protocol. If students get stuck while working on their project, students can follow these steps and share their bug with the class to get help. Ask for a student to share their bug with the class and then facilitate a discussion around the bug.
  >>“Today you are going to work on your flower garden projects on Minecraft. If you need help debugging, follow these three steps and ask the class for help.”

  <iconp type='question'>Does anyone have a bug they would like to share and get help from the class?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Help guide student to share their code with the class over the projector and to talk through the Debugging Protocol.</iconp>

#### 2. Elaborate/Evaluate: Project Time (50-55 minutes)

- [ ] **Project Time:** Students continue coding their final projects. Sometime during project time ask the class if anyone would like to share their bug and receive input from the class.
 >>“Today you will continue coding your final project. By the end of today you should be more than halfway done.”



- [ ] **Evaluate/Circulate:** While students work independently, circulate and check in with each student. Review student progress on projects.
  - Check for: Progress on coding project: Student should be more than halfway done, otherwise their design will need to be simplified.
