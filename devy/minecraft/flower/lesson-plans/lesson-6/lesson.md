Students continue working on their flower garden project. If students get stuck they follow the 3 steps to debug and get assistance from their peers.

#### 1. Engage: Debugging (5-10 minutes)

- [ ] **Debugging:** Review and read the Debugging Protocol. If students get stuck while working on their project, students can follow these steps and share their bug with the class to get help. Talk through the Debugging Protocol for the example bug.
  >>“Today you are going to work on your flower garden projects on Minecraft. If you need help debugging, follow these three steps and ask the class for help. Let’s practice using these debugging steps with this example bug. *read through slides*”


#### 2. Elaborate/Evaluate: Project Time (50-55 minutes)

- [ ] **Project Time:** Students continue coding their final projects. If students finish their flower design, students can begin their garden. Their garden will consists of multiple builds of their flower.
  >>“Today you will continue coding your final project. After you have finished your design, you can create a new file to code turtle to build multiple flowers, just like we saw in the debugging challenge.”


- [ ] **Evaluate/Circulate:** While students work independently, circulate and check in with each student. Review student progress on projects.
  - Check for: Progress on coding project: Student should be almost done, otherwise their design will need to be changed/simplified.
