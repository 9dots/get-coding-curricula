- **Function call** - A programming element that tells the computer to do something. In the beginning, most function calls will cause the computer to perform an action.

#### 1. Engage/Explore: Turtle Commands (7 minutes)

- [ ] **Compare & Contrast:** Students compare two different programs that both code turtle to build a vertical line.

  <iconp type='question'>We’re starting today’s lesson with a read code activity. Look at these two programs. What differences do you notice between the two programs? Write your answer in your coding journals.</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What does each program code turtle to build? Use the foam turtles, grids, and omnifix cubes to help you read the code.</iconp>


- [ ] **Discuss** as a class the differences in the programs, one using turtle.place() and the other using turtle.placeDown(). As a whole class, students will predict what turtle.placeDown() will do.

  <iconp type='question'>What are the differences you found?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Students should find that one program uses turtle.place() and the other uses turtle.placeDown()</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Are there any similarities between these two programs?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Students should notice they build the same structure, a vertical line.</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>We know what turtle.place does, what do you think turtle.placeDown will do? </iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>On the board, write students’ prediction of what turtle.placeDown will do.</iconp>



#### 2. Explain: turtle.placeDown (8 minutes)

- [ ] **Code Along:** Together as a class log into Minecraft, then code Program 2 on Minecraft and check and discuss students’ prediction of turtle.placeDown.
  >>“Let’s code Program 2 together and run the code to check our prediction. How did we do?”

<pagebreak/>
#### 3. Elaborate: Build Challenges (45 minutes)

- [ ]**Independent Practice:** Students continue to program turtle to build in Minecraft. Students reference build challenges in Minecraft.
  >>“We have two ways to code turtle to build; turtle.place() and turtle.placeDown(). For the remainder of the class you will practice coding turtle to build the challenges in Minecraft. When is it best to use place or placeDown? Challenge yourself to use both of these function calls and find out!”
