<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students design an animal in PixelBots using rectangle and triangle shapes. In the next few lessons, students will code their cubism animal using their rectangle and triangle functions.

- **Ideate:** generate ideas
- **Prototype:** a first functional form of a new design
- **Plan:** a detailed outline for doing or achieving something
- **Decomposition:** breaking a problem or system into parts that are easier to understand and program.

#### 1. Engage: Animal Cubism Project (5 minutes)
- [ ] **Motivate:** Reintroduce the Animal Cubism Final Project.
  >>“Today you will begin your project by designing your cubism animal! All great creations go through a planning process and today you will ideate, prototype, and decompose your design before you start coding."

#### 2. Explain/Elaborate: Ideate, Prototype, and Decomposition (55 minutes)
**IDEATE:** (10 minutes) Students will brainstorm all their possible ideas for an animal they want to design.

- [ ] **Model:** Create as many ideas as you can for an animal and sketch out ideas on the board.
  >>“I really like dogs, so I want to create a cubism dog. I want the dog to be sitting in the grass with a light blue sky background.”

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students ideate and sketch what their cubism animal might look like.
  >>“Your turn. List as many ideas as you can for your design and sketch them out in your coding journal.”

**PROTOTYPE:** (25 minutes) Students will create a prototype of their cubism animal on PixelBots.

- [ ] **Model:** Show the prototype of [cubism dog on PixelBots (code: 5MR48)][dog]. Demonstrate using the paint and eraser tool on PixelBots to paint their prototype.
  >>“I decided for this project to create a dog. Here is what my prototype looks like. A prototype is your first model, or draft, of what you will create. Watch as I show you how to create your own prototype on PixelBots.”

<pagebreak/>

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students prototype their favorite pixel emoji idea on [Cubism | Project][project] challenge on PixelBots. Guide students how to get to the cubism project challenge (code: 96MYZ).
    >>“Your turn. Design and prototype your animal on pixelBots. Remember, for this project we want to be able to code and paint our animals using our rectangle and triangle functions. Focus on creating your prototype with these shapes in mind.”

**DECOMPOSITION:** (20 minutes) Students will break down the main parts of their prototype so that they are ready to code their project in purposeful parts.

- [ ] **Model:** Go through Decomposing Art slide and show how to use comments in pixelBots to decompose their design.
    >>“Before I jump into coding my dog, I need to break it into simpler parts. This is called decomposition. Watch as I decompose the parts of my design. Your decomposed design will be the plan of how you code your animal in pixelBots.”

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students decompose their animal by writing comments in PixelBots.
    >>“Your turn. Decompose your animal prototype and create a comment for each of the decomposed parts of your design.”

- [ ] **Pair Share:**  In pairs, students share their prototype and give one positive comment about their partners emoji.
   >>“Coders like to share their projects and get input from other coders. Turn to your table partner and share your prototype. Partners, tell each other one thing you like about their design. Be specific.”

#### 3. Evaluate: Check Prototypes

- [ ] **Project Benchmark:** During class, check for completed prototype on Challenge and for comments of decomposition for each student.
