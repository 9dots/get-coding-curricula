<iconp src='/icons/vocab.png'>### Vocabulary</iconp>
- **Argument:** specific value supplied to a function call
- **String:** a sequence of characters or words
- **Loop*:** A sequence of instructions that is repeated a set number of times.
- **Comment:** A note in the code that makes the program more readable and is ignored by the computer

#### 1. Engage: Animal Cubism Project (5 minutes)
- [ ] **Motivate:** Discuss Cubism Art and then reveal the Animal Cubism project over the projector. Show students the code and the bot painting the example animal cubism dog (code: 5MR48).
  >>“In this class you are going to design and paint an animal with code! Using JavaScript,  you will code a bot to paint your animal project on PixelBots. Here is an example of a dog and the program.”
  *Show dog and code.*
  “Before we can begin a project like this, we need to know the fundamental coding concepts: sequencing, arguments, and loops. Today we will review and practice these concepts through PixelBot Challenges. ”


#### 2. Explore: Read. Write. Debug. (16 minutes)
- [ ] **Code Along:**  Students follow along on their own computer as you walk through each step of logging onto PixelBots.
 >> “Open your computers and follow along as we walk through the steps of going to PixelBots.io and logging in to our accounts.”

 - Steps:
    1. Open Chrome and type ‘www.pixelbots.io’ in the address bar
    1. Click on ‘Log In’  and ‘Sign in with Google’
    1. Type in email and password.
             Email: firstlaststudent@9dots.org
             Password: student5 or student6
    1. Navigate to playlist: click ‘Code’, type playlist code: ‘8QX8D’, and click ‘go’

  - Tip: Uphold good classroom management on computers. When you give each step, students should have eyes on you and hands off computers.


- [ ] **Pair Programming:** Students will work in pairs on one computer to read, write and debug code in PixelBot challenges. Students will take turns as driver and navigator, switching after each challenge. There are 6 challenges total, each students will be able to act as each role for the three types of challenges.
  - Tip: Students who are new to PixelBots should be paired with students who have taken the devY PixelBots class before. New students should be the ones with hands on the computer.
  - Playlist consists of three types of challenges:
    - Read - Students read given code and paint the picture the code would produce.
    - Write - Students use code to move a bot to paint a given image.
    - Debug - Students are given code to fix to paint a given image.

  >>“You will be working in pairs to complete read, write, and debug challenges on PixelBots. In Read challenges, you will read code paint the picture the code would produce. In Write challenges you will code the bot to paint a given picture. In Debug challenges, you will fix written code to paint a picture.”


#### 3. Explain: Platform (10 minutes)
- [ ] **Connecting Prior Knowledge:** Connect vocabulary words with code of one of the challenges above. Call students up to the board to circle the part of the program that matches the given vocabulary word in the program.

  <iconp type='question'>Circle a few function calls in this program.</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How do we know that is a function call?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Circle the arguments.</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Define argument.</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Which argument is a string?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Circle a comment.</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Define comment.</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Circle 2 Loops.</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How do we know this is a loop?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What code is being repeated in this loop?</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How many times does this loop repeat?</iconp>



#### 4. Elaborate: PixelBots Playlist (19 minutes)
- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students continue to work on the [Lesson 1 playlist][playlist] to continue practicing JavaScript. Students will continue to use sequencing, arguments, and loops to read, write, and debug code.
  - Playlist consists of three types of challenges:
    - Read - Students read given code and paint the picture the code would produce.
    - Write - Students use code to move a bot to paint a given image.
    - Debug - Students are given code to fix to paint a given image.

  >>“Continue to practice writing code using function calls, arguments, strings, and loops on the PixelBots Playlist.”


#### 5. Evaluate: Exit Challenge (10  minutes)

- [ ] **Call and Response:** teach students the call and response. Teacher says: “I have a challenge for you.” Students say: “Bring it, bring it.”
  >>“I’m going to teach you a call and response. Whenever you hear me say ‘I have a challenge for you’, you will respond as a class and say ‘Bring it, bring it’. Let’s try it. ‘I have a challenge for you’ … (students respond ‘Bring it, bring it.’)”


- [ ] **Exit Challenge:** Students work independently to write a program to complete the Exit Challenge on the [Cubism| Lesson 1 playlist][playlist].
  >>“Okay coders, I have a challenge for you. *pause for students’ response*   Use what we learned today to complete the Exit Challenge at the end of the playlist! You will work on this challenge independently to show me and yourself what you learned this lesson.”


- [ ] **Evaluate:** Circulate and check code to determine student’s understanding of sequencing, arguments, and loops in Javascript on PixelBots.
