<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students learn to pass numbers and strings as arguments to function calls forward() and paint(). A number can be typed in between the parenthesis of forward() to code the bot to move multiple steps forward. For example, ‘forward(4)’ will move the bot forward 4 steps. A string, which is a sequence of characters, can be typed in between the parenthesis of paint() to code the bot to paint a square a specific color. For example, ‘paint(‘blue’)’ will paint the square the bot is on blue.

#### 1. Engage: Debugging Challenge (7 minutes)
- [ ] **Challenge:** Students are first introduced to arguments in a debugging challenge on Emoji | Argument playlist. Walk students through opening PixelBots and navigating to a playlist. Then without any direct instruction, give students three minutes to debug the program.

  >> “We’re starting today’s lesson with a debugging challenge! You will see code that looks different than the last time we coded in PixelBots. I challenge you to figure out what is happening in the code. You will have three minutes and I want you to focus on using the stepper tool as you debug. The stepper allows you to run your program line by line, it’s a powerful tool many coders use to debug their code.”


- [ ] **Discuss:** Facilitate a class discussion about the debugging challenge.

  <iconp type='question'>How was that challenge? </iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Student answers will vary. </iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How did you find the bugs? Is using the stepper effective? Why?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Students using the stepper can see the action of each line. The bug can be found by stepping through the code and as soon as an action is not what the coder wanted, that is where the error/bug is located.</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How did you try to fix them?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Line 7 - change 9 to 6 </iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Line 11 - add quotes around pink</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Line 13 - change 3 to 6</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Line 14 - g needs to be capitalized, ‘lightGreen’</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>How is this challenge different than other challenge you’ve seen? What was different about the types of instructions you could give the pixelBot?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Students should notice the bot can move multiple steps and paint different colors.</iconp>

  >>“Great coders, you debugged code that was new and used arguments which is what we will be learning about today.”

#### 2. Explore: Colors & Multiple Steps (7 minutes)
- [ ] **Compare & Contrast:** Students find the difference between two photos of PixelBots editor with code.
  <iconp type='question'>Look at these two photos of the pixelBots editor. What difference do you notice between the two photos? Write your answer in your coding journals.</iconp>


- [ ] **Discuss** as a class the differences in the photos and how ‘color’ and ‘steps’ tie into today’s lesson. As a whole class, students will come up with a definition of arguments. Write their definition on the board for the class to see.

  <iconp type='question'>What are the differences you found? What are the differences in the API and the code?</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Student should find these two differences in the API: the word color and step are in between the parenthesis of paint and forward.</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'> Students should find that the program on the right uses specific numbers and colors, ‘red’, 3, 4, ‘blue’</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>What do you think this new information in the API means? </iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>The bot can be programed to paint in different colors and move forward more than one step at a time.</iconp>
  <iconp type='question'>Today’s lesson is about arguments, in the debugging challenge we used specific numbers inside of the parenthesis of forward, and specific colors inside of paint. These specific numbers and specific colors are arguments. Knowing that, how would you define arguments? </iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>On the board, write students’ definition of arguments. </iconp>


#### 3. Explain: Arguments & Strings (6 minutes)
- [ ] **Define** arguments. Students write definition in their coding journal.
  >>“Here is how computer scientists define arguments: a specific value supplied to a function call.”

  <iconp type='question'>How did we do? Does our definition match?”</iconp>
  <iconp type='answer'>Allow students to discuss this. They may need help understanding the words in the definition. They should be allowed to add to or modify their definition.</iconp>


#### 4. Elaborate: PixelBots Challenges (25 minutes)
- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students work to complete challenges in playlist using arguments.
Playlist consists of three types of challenges:
    - Read - Students read given code and paint the picture the code would produce.
    - Write - Students use code to move a bot to paint a given image.
    - Debug - Students are given code to fix to paint a given image.
  >>“Now that we’ve learned about arguments, we can code pixelbots to paint colorful pictures. In these next challenges, practice reading, writing, and debugging code using arguments.”

- [ ] **Circulate** and ask students questions that require them to use the words “argument” and “string”.
  - Can you explain this code here?
  - What is that in between the parenthesis?
  - What type of argument did you use to paint that color?


#### 5. Evaluate: Exit Challenge (10  minutes)

- [ ] **Exit Challenge:** Students work independently to write a program using arguments to complete the Exit Challenge on the Emoji | Arguments playlist.
>>“Okay coders, I have a challenge for you. *pause for students’ response*   Use arguments to complete the Exit Challenge at the end of the playlist. You will work on this challenge independently to show me and yourself what you learned this lesson.”

- [ ] **Evaluate:** Circulate and check code to determine student’s understanding of arguments and writing code in PixelBots to paint a picture. If students complete the exit challenge early, they can continue to work on the PixelBots Challenges from the playlist.
