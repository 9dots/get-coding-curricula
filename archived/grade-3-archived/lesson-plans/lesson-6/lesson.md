<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Students learn to read code with loops by stepping through one block at a time. Using pre-written code, students guide Rover the robot’s movements as it paints a grid.

<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can step through and act out code that contains a loop.
- I can predict the effects of code that contains a loop.

- **Loop:** A sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.

</note>

## 1. Engage: Why Loops? (5 min)

- [ ] **Engaging Prior Knowledge:** Students connect loops from previous lesson to simplify a long sequence of code.

> > “Let’s read Rover’s code together.”

<iconp type="question">Is there another way to write this code? </iconp>
<iconp type="answer"> Hint to last week’s lesson to get students to suggest using a repeat loop.</iconp>
<iconp type="question">Do both sets of instructions get Rover to the goal?  </iconp>
<iconp type="answer">Yes </iconp>
<iconp type="question">Then why would we use a loop to write this code?  </iconp>
<iconp type="answer">A loop requires less lines of code. </iconp>

## 2. Explore: Loops in GIFs (5 min)

- [ ] **Making Connections:** Students see how loops apply to something they are familiar with: GIFs (an image format that repeats an animation).

> > “Let’s look at some GIFs and see how loops are creating the animation we see.”

<iconp type="question">What might the code look like for this GIF?</iconp>
<iconp type="answer">See code suggestions on slides. Students should nest the action they are seeing inside a loop block.</iconp>

- [ ] **Enemy Loops:** Show students the Escape the Maze GIF and identify one of the enemy’s movements as a loop.

<iconp type="question">In this animation of our Escape the Maze project, what do you notice about the enemies?</iconp>
<iconp type="answer">Each enemy is moving in a loop. The actions they are doing repeat. This is because the code they are reading has a loop in it. </iconp>

## 3. Explain: Rover Paints (5 min)

- [ ] **Model** the steps to read a chunk of code that contains a loop. Have students follow along on their handout. Uncover each line of code one at a time using an index card. Make a tally at the end of the sequence to keep track of how many times you’ve repeated the sequence.

> > “Before we can write the code to make our enemies move in a loop, we need to know how to read the code. We are going to use Rover to practice reading loops. Today Rover understands a new instruction - Paint. When Rover sees a Paint block, he will color in the square he is on.”

> > “Use your index card to uncover each line of code one block at a time.”
Narrate what you’re doing at each step.
> > “Make a tally mark at the bottom of the loop.”

<iconp type="question">How many times have I done this sequence? </iconp>
<iconp type="answer">Read the tally marks </iconp>
<iconp type="question">How many times do I need to repeat the sequence? </iconp>
<iconp type="answer">4. </iconp>
<iconp type="question">Am I done? </iconp>
<iconp type="answer">yes/no.</iconp>

## 4. Elaborate/Evaluate: Practice (10 min)

- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students step through the remaining chunks of code on their paper using the steps you modeled.

<note>
![slides-p1](./images/slides-p1.png)
</note>

- [ ] **Coder & Bot:** Have one Coder and Bot read and act out the code on the unplugged platform to check their work on each practice problem.

> > "I need one student to be the Coder and read the sequence one line at a time. A second student will be the Bot and act it out on the foam tiles."

![slides-practice3](./images/slides-practice3.png)


- [ ] **Evaluate:** Choose one problem that you did not go over as a class to collect as your exit challenge.

## 5. Extension: Independent Coding (20-35 min)

- [ ] **Independent Coding:** Students move at their own pace through the Code.org studios. Play the video to introduce students to using Code.org if you did not start with Lesson 00: Digital Literacy.
