## Activities

### 1. Unearth

Building on students' prior thinking is central to good teaching. Each pedagogical practice in this section unearths how students think about a topic coming into the lesson. 

#### ***Analogy***
1. Start with an idea for students to learn
2. Come up with two analogies for that idea
3. Transform each analogy into a problem
4. Ask students to solve each problem
5. Have students propose commonalities between the two analogies
6. Nudge students to describe the commonalities in general terms
6. Ask students to make sense of the original idea using the common structure from the two analogies

#### ***Contrasting Cases***

1. Start with an idea for students to learn
2. Think about what you want students to notice about this idea
2. Present two versions of the idea that vary along the dimension you want students to notice
2. Ask students to identify differences between the two versions
3. Ask students to predict/explain how these differences matter

#### ***Question Driven***
1. Find out what interests students
2. Have students generate questions about the topic or have them select from questions you provide
3. Nudge the students to make these questions big enough to encompass many ideas worth exploring
4. Help students decompose questions into tractable lines of inquiry

#### ***Productive Failure***
1. Design a problem that students can tackle but which they won't likely solve
2. The problem should be complex enough to allow for multiple solution strategies
3. Remind students why productive failure is valuable
4. Ask students in groups to creatively and fearlessly work through the problem
5. Have students describe the ways they attempted to solve the problem
6. Compare and contrast students' approaches to solving the problem
7. Build on students' thinking to assemble an explanation of how to solve the problem

### 2. Remind
The reminding practice is simply about refreshing students' memories about something they have already learned. 

#### ***Recollection***
1. Give students partial prompts to remember something they have already learned 
2. Ask students to freely recall something they have already learned
3. Space out memory exercises

### 3. Demonstrate
Watching someone demonstrate how to perform a skill can be immensely helpful for learners. This practice is about organizing these demonstrations in as effective was as possible. 

#### ***Observation***
1. Start with an idea/skill students should learn
2. Segment the idea/skill into relevant stages
3. Model live how to execute the idea/skill

#### ***Worked Examples***
1. Start with an idea/skill students should learn
3. Create a representation of how you execute the idea/skill:
 - Break down the steps required to execute the idea/skill
 - Explain the reason for each step
 - Highlight any subgoals
 - Reduce distracting complexity
 - Keep students' attention focused on one place
3. Ask students to self-explain worked examples
8. Set up problem pairs (one worked example beside an unsolved problem)

### 4. Support
It pays to give students freedom to practice what they have learned. In these cases, the teacher designs effective forms of practice, paces the activities, and motivates students -- in short, the teacher moves into a support role. 

#### ***Preparation***
1. Preparation is best suited when there is an authentic context to apply the targeted skill
2. Preparation should be effortful and focused
3. Preparation should take place in short sessions of intense concentration
3. Preparation should target specific skills not yet automated
4. Students should receive immediate feedback
5. Preparation should be spaced out

#### ***Self explanation***
1. Ask students to keep track of what they understand
2. Ask students to make connections between ideas
3. Ask students to make predictions
4. Give students activities where they map out their thinking (e.g. in a concept map) 

### 5. Coordinate
These activities involve students collaborating with one another and the teacher stepping into a coordination role. 

#### ***Teaching***
1. Student prepares to teach a peer (e.g. by building a concept map)
2. Student actually teaches the peer
3. Student watches as the peer tries to solve a problem with the new knowledge 

#### ***Listening and Sharing***
1. Set norms for collaboration:
 - Attend to needs of group members 
 - No one is done until everyone is done
 - Justify thinking
 - Ask questions to find our what group members think
 - etc.
2. Design activities that can't be completed alone
3. Have students brainstorm independently before joining together as a group 

#### ***Role Play***
See our [role play](roleplays/README.md) protocols. 

### 6. Evaluate
Assessing what students know and how they feel about the class should be regular occurrences in the classroom. Formative and summative assessments keep us honest about how well our lessons are working. 

#### ***Feedback***
1. Ask students to independently solve short problems to gauge their knowledge
2. You may also choose to assess non-cognitive experiences: 
  - student comfort with the concepts
  - student interest in the lesson
  - student ideas for improving the class
  - etc. 
3. Use multiple choice, likert scales, or free response questions

## Constant Practices
### 1. Motivate
This is the pulse of learning -- without it, not much happens. 
#### ***Self efficacy***
1. Talk with students about a number of motivating ideas:
 - Self-efficacy
 - Mastery over performance
 - Attributions that pinpoint changeable factors
 - Fixed versus growth mindset
 - Long-term purpose
 - Grit

### 2. Engrain
Norms guide how we interact with one another and how we pursue knowledge. Both are essential to a joyful and productive learning environment.
#### *** Norms***
1. Explain the rationale for norms
2. Model the norms
3. Remind students frequently about the norms
4. Tie the norms to specific academic practices in the classroom
