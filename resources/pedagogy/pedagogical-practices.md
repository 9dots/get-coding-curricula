## Pedagogical Practices for Activities

### 1. Unearth
Building on students' prior thinking is central to good teaching. Each pedagogical practice in this section unearths how students think about a topic coming into the lesson. 

#### ***Analogy***
1. Start with an idea for students to learn
2. Come up with two analogies for that idea
3. Transform each analogy into a problem
4. Ask students to solve each problem
5. Have students propose commonalities between the two analogies
6. Nudge students to describe the commonalities in general terms
6. Ask students to make sense of the original idea using the common structure from the two analogies

#### ***Contrasting Cases***

1. Start with an idea for students to learn
2. Think about what you want students to notice about this idea
2. Present two versions of the idea that vary along the dimension you want students to notice
2. Ask students to identify differences between the two versions
3. Ask students to predict/explain how these differences matter

#### ***Question Driven***
1. Find out what interests students
2. Have students generate questions about the topic or have them select from questions you provide
3. Nudge the students to make these questions big enough to encompass many ideas worth exploring
4. Help students decompose questions into tractable lines of inquiry

#### ***Productive Failure***
1. Design a problem too difficult for students but which students have resources to tackle
2. The problem should be complex enough to allow for multiple solution strategies
3. Remind students why productive failure is valuable
4. Ask students in groups to creatively and diligently work through the problem
5. Have students describe the ways they attempted to solve the problem
6. Compare and contrast students' approaches to solving the problem
7. Build on students' thinking to assemble an explanation of how to solve the problem

### 2. Remind
#### ***Generation***
1. Give students partial prompts to remember something they already learned 
2. Ask students to freely recall something they have already learned
3. Space out memory exercises

### Support
#### ***Deliberate Practice***
1.  Have students practice the activity spaced out throughout the unit/year

### Demonstrate
#### ***Observation***
#### ***Worked Examples***

### Coordinate
#### ***Teaching***
#### ***Play***
#### ***Listening and Sharing***

### Evaluate
#### ***Feedback***
