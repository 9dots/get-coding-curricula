# Coding Level 2

Students are introduced to core coding concepts: sequences, calling functions, passing arguments, creating loops, and using conditionals. New concepts are introduced in a steady progression from an icon based language, to block language, and finally to fully typed JavaScript. This course includes lesson plans: unplugged and online, worksheets, and a custom-designed coding environment.
