Students are given different code elements to solve similar pixel bots problems.

**Prep:** Draw a medium difficulty coding challenge on the board.

{% table %}

1) Draw the normal icon elements students are accustomed to and ask students to use them to solve the puzzle.
2) Discuss student solutions.
3) Introduce students to a different set of elements (degree turns -- see the arrows below) by drawing them on the board. What do students think they mean? How much should they turn right? How much should they turn left? How far should they move forward?
- `↑` - move one block forward
- `⟳` - turn right 90 degrees
- `⟲` - turn left 90 degrees
4) Students solve the puzzle using the new code elements.
5) **Discuss:** What was the difference between the elements? How do the elements you have affect your solution?

,,,

1) Students use the elements to develop a solution.
2) Students raise their hands to offer solutions.
3) Students raise their hands to discuss the new elements.
4) Students solve the problem using the new elements.
5) Students raise their hand to discuss the difference when using new elements.

 Introduce students to code.org by projecting the teacher screen and solving a maze puzzle as a class.

**Prep:**

1. Set up projector
2. Navigate to https://studio.code.org/s/course2/stage/3/puzzle/1.

{% table %}

1) Point out that code.org uses a different **programming language**.
1. Ask students to look at the available code elements (on the left side of the editor) and talk about what is different from pixelbots.io
2. A programming language is how a person can communicate with a computer. There are many programming languages.
3. Pixel bots used an icon language. Code.org uses a block based language.
2)  students the projected screen and show them how to use the code.org interface:
- How to drag and drop blocks into the code editor
- How to run the code
- How to reset after a run
3) As a class solve the first puzzle.

,,,

1) Students offer answers about the differences between the elements in pixelbots.io and code.org
2) Students are off the computer and facing the teacher
3) Students raise their hands to offer answers about what blocks to add to the code.

{% length '30 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

 Students do the rest of the Code.org maze puzzles on their own.

{% table %}

1) Explain the exercise and facilitate students navigating their browsers to the correct place.
1. Students navigate to studio.code.org
2. Click on course 2
3. Click on the first Stage 3: Maze: Sequence
2) Tell students to work through as many of the exercises as they can.
3) When students get stuck, use the Writing, Reading, and Debugging protocols to support student learning. Ask students to imagine being on the Coder team from the group activities. They should try to play the roles of the writer and navigator. Then, ask students to imagine being a Bot to understand how the computer is reading the code.

,,,

1) Students open their web browsers and navigate to the challenges
1. Students navigate to studio.code.org
2. Click on course 2
3. Click on the first Stage 3: Maze: Sequence
2) Students work on completing the mazes.
