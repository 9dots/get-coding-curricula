Students practice writing basic javascript to create a simple Pixel Bot drawing.

**Prep:** Hand out Lesson 8 | Warm-up Worksheet

{% table %}

1) **Individual Work:** Ask students to write the code to produce the Pixel Bot image in the Lesson 8 | Warm-up Worksheet. Consider reminding students of the proper JavaScript syntax (see Elements on the worksheet).
2) Draw the Pixel Bot image on the whiteboard and code the solution with the students, randomly calling on one student at a time to provide each next line of code. (Note the problem can be solved in different ways. Students should follow the classâ€™ ongoing code which may differ from their own solution).

,,,

1) Students individually fill out the Warm-up Worksheet.
2) If called on, students call out the next line of code.

Students write code in JavaScript on the getcoding.io platform to help the squirrel gather acorns. Students are practicing simple sequences.

**Prep:** Have the getcoding.io platform open on your browser and projected on the wall. Students should also have their own computers.

{% table %}

1) Walk students through the getcoding.io platform. Show students how to:
  - open activities
  - use the Code Editor (where to type)
  - see elements
  - run code
  - step through the code one line at a time
  - change the speed
2) Ask students to browse to getcoding.io and start moving through the challenges in the Calling Functions squirrel activity.  Explain the goal of the activity: Move the squirrel to the nut and pick it up. Tell students they are free to continue on to the second squirrel challenge when they are ready.
3) When students get stuck, we suggest using the Read, Write, and Debug protocols to support students. Ask students to imagine being on the Coder team from the group activities. They should try to play the roles of the writer and navigator. Then, ask students to imagine being a Bot to understand how the computer reads the code.

2) Students start solving the challenges in the Calling Functions squirrel activities.

Talk with a peer about how the code is working.

**Prep:** None

{% table %}

1) Ask students to pause their progress and talk with a neighbor about their current problem. What is their plan? What have they tried? Is there anything standing in their way? Important: Ask students to offer questions instead of solutions.

{% length '10 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

Students continue writing code in JavaScript on the getcoding.io platform to help the squirrel gather acorns.

**Prep:** None

{% table %}

1) Ask students to resume coding individually in the Calling Functions squirrel activity.

{% header title='Unplugged Exit Ticket', icon='objectives' %}
{% endheader %}

{% length '5 minutes' %}
{% endlength %}

Students individually fill out an exit ticket focused on simple sequence.

**Prep:** Hand out Lesson 8 | Exit Ticket.

{% table %}

1) **Individual Work:** Ask students to fill out the Exit Ticket. Draw their attention to the Elements on the Exit Ticket worksheet because they differ ever so slightly from the squirrel elements.

1) Students fill out the exit ticket.
