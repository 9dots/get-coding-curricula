Coding is so much more than a language--it's a tool. A tool for creating video games, music, and art. A tool for changing the world.

We believe that all students should be equipped with the coding skills they need to be creators and active citizens in the new digital world, not just consumers.

Our coding curriculum gives you the tools you need to empower your students to be digital developers, artists and citizens. Our curriculum is broken up into 3 stages:

1. **preCoder** - An introduction to coding concepts for students who do not yet have the language skills to read and write. (grades K-2)
2. **[coder](coder)** - A slowly paced deep dive into core coding concepts through puzzle based lessons. (grades 3-8)
3. **developer** - An exploration of the many applications of coding concepts through project and product based lessons. (grades 3-8)

Ideally students would start with preCoder and then start working on coder and developer stages in 3rd grade. However, teachers should feel free to grab units from preCoder, coder, and developer as they see fit.
