# Welcome to getCoding

Coding is so much more than a language--it's a tool. A tool for creating video games, music, and art. A tool for changing the world.

We believe that all students should be equipped with the coding skills they need to be creators and active citizens in the new digital world, not just consumers.

Our coding curriculum gives your educators the tools they need to empower students to be digital developers, artists and citizens.
