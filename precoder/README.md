The preCoder series serves as an introduction to reading, writing, and debugging code for pre-readers. Beginning coders develop a foundational level of understanding of fundamental coding concepts through unplugged activities, games, and the [pixelBot][pixel-bot] platform.

## Curriculum

- [Level 1](../precoder/level-1/index.html)


## Purpose

2. Empower students to apply computational practices to understand and change the world.

## Big Goals
1. Students will utilize computational thinking to read their world and will utilize their coding skills to write their world.
2. Students will experience failure as a learning opportunity to master core concepts and the process of creation.

## Big Ideas
1. When code breaks, we fearlessly, creatively, and systematically debug it.

## Essential Questions
1. When your code breaks or when you get stuck, what can you do?
