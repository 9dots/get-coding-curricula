<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 4 students are introduced to sequences and begin developing an understanding of how to read code. Students learn how to step through sequences of 2-5 arrow directions with the aid of a token.

1. **Engage: Intro to Sequences (5 min)** Students see examples of sequences in different contexts and are introduced to the definition of a sequence.
1. **Explore: Stepping (2 min)** Students are challenged to determine the position of an object after following a sequence of directions.
1. **Explain: Stepping Demonstration (8 min)** Students learn how to step through code using a token.
1. **Elaborate: Independent Practice (10 min)** Students complete an independent practice worksheet.
1. **Evaluate: Exit Ticket (3 min)** Students complete an exit ticket.

## Engage: Intro to Sequences (5 min)

- [ ] Present the sequence in slide 2 to the class and ask:

<iconp type='question'>Where would the turtle stop if I pressed the buttons in order starting from the top?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>The turtle will end up on the G.</iconp>

<br/>

- [ ] Explain that the buttons shown on the board are an example of a sequence.
- [ ] Have students repeat the word in unison until all students are able to pronounce it.
- [ ] Explain that a sequence is  a set of actions that happen a specific order.
- [ ] Show the example of a sequence in slide 3.
- [ ] Show slide 4 and ask


<iconp type='question'>What is similar about the sequences you see on the board?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Both sequences are numbered.</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Both sequences give directions that complete a task.</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Both sequences are ordered from top to bottom.</iconp>

<br/>

<iconp type='question'>What is different about the sequences you see on the board?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>One sequence uses words and the other does not.</iconp>

<br/>

-  [ ] Explain that each sequence contains a set of directions and they are numbered to show in the order they’re supposed to be followed.

## Explore: Stepping (2 min)

- [ ] Give students a stepping board, a marker, and a token.
- [ ] Have students place their token at the start block.
- [ ] Direct students to try and determine which letter the token would stop on if it followed the sequence on the right hand side of the board.

## Explain: Stepping (8 min)

- [ ] Demonstrate how to step through the sequence using the token cutout on the board.
   1. Move the token one step at a time
   1. As each direction in the sequence is completed, place a checkmark next to it.
   1. Repeat the process until the token reaches it’s final destination.
- [ ] Project slide 5 and demonstrate how to complete it using the same process described above.
- [ ] Invite two students to come up to the board to read and act out the code in slide 6. 
   1. One student will read and check mark the directions in the sequence. 
   1. The second student will move the token.
- [ ] Have the students read and act out the code together.

## Elaborate: Independent Practice (7 min)

- [ ] Have students complete the independent practice worksheet independently. Monitor the class for students in need of assistance.
- [ ] Review 2-3 problems from the worksheet with the group by having student volunteers share out their answers. 

## Exit Ticket (3 min)

- [ ] Have students complete the exit ticket to check for understanding.
