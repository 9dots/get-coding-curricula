![grid-one](./images/grid-one.png)

- [ ] Repeat step 2 three more times to ensure that students have practiced using all four directional commands.
- [ ] Place the star in a square at one end of the floor grid and stand in a square on the opposite end of the grid as shown in the picture below.

![grid-two](./images/grid-two.png)

- [ ] Have the class press the button they would use to get you closer to the star.
- [ ] Have a volunteer share out their selection and ask the class to agree or disagree. Once the class has settled on a button choice act out their selection. Repeat this process until the class has successfully navigated you to the star.
