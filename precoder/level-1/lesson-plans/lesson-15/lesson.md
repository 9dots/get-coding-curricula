<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
Lesson 15 introduces students to patterns in preparation to learn how to loop code. Through exploration students develops their own definition of a pattern and learn to identify the repeating sequence in a pattern.


<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>
- I can complete a pattern.
- I can identify the repeating sequence in a pattern.

## Engage: Pat-terns (2 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** the word pattern and have students practice pronouncing it.
>> "Today we are learning about patterns. Repeat after me, pat-terns."

## Explore: What are Patterns? (5 min)
- [ ] **Present** examples of patterns.
>> “Each of the following pictures is an example of a pattern. See if you can find what they all have in common.”

- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Pairs discuss the commonalities among the examples.
<iconp type='question'>What do all of the examples have in common?</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Volunteers share out their observations.

- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Pairs define the word pattern based on their observations.
<iconp type='question'>What do you think a pattern is?</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Pairs share out their definition of the word pattern.

## Explain: Identify the Pattern (10 min)
- [ ] **Define** pattern.
>> “In each of the examples you just saw something was repeating. A pattern is a repeating sequence.”

- [ ] **Demonstrate** the pattern hand signal.

- [ ] **Practice:** Have students practice repeating the hand signal while saying the word.

- [ ] **Model** completing a color pattern by saying the colors out loud rhythmically.
>> “I have to complete the pattern by coloring in the final two circles. To find out which colors they should be I will look for a pattern. The colors are red, blue, red, blue, red, blue. So the next two circles are red and blue.”

- [ ] **Guided Practice:** The class works together to complete a set of patterns.
>> “Let’s say the colors we see in order out loud. yellow, purple, yellow. purple, yellow, purple.”

<iconp type='question'>What colors should the next two circles be?</iconp>

- [ ] **Model** completing the pattern and identifying the repeating sequence.
>> “In order to find the repeating sequence of the pattern, I want to look for the beginning and ending of a sequence. This example shows red, red, blue, red, red, blue. So the repeating sequence begins at red and ends with blue. To show this I will box the three circles starting at red and end with the blue one.”

- [ ] **Guided Practice:** completing the pattern and identifying the repeating sequence.
>> “Let’s try one together. Say the colors with me. Red, yellow, blue, red, yellow, blue. “

<iconp type='question'>What colors should come next to complete the pattern?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Where does the repeating sequence begin and where does it end?</iconp>

## Elaborate: Independent Practice (13 min)
- [ ] **Explain** how to complete the patterns worksheet with problem number 1.
>> “In each of the problems on the worksheet we are going to (1) complete the pattern and (2) circle the repeating sequence. Problem number 1 shows the pattern blue, red, blue, red.”

<iconp type='question'>What colors should the next two circles be?</iconp>

- [ ] **Demonstrate** how to complete the patterns worksheet.
>> “Since the next two colors should be blue and red, I will color them in with my color pencils and circle the repeating sequence.”

<iconp type='question'>Where does the repeating sequence begin and where does it end?</iconp>

- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students complete the patterns worksheet.
- [ ] **Monitor** the room for students in need of additional assistance.
- [ ] **Review** examples 3, 8 and 12 with the class.
- [ ] **Debrief** the lesson.

<iconp type='question'>What two things did we learn to do today?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Today we learned how to (1) complete a pattern and (2) identify its repeating sequence.</iconp>
