<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 7 students are introduced to sequences with increasing complexity. Complexity arises from the addition of directional moves and increasing length. Students practice reading code by stepping through it one line at a time.


<iconp src='/icons/objectives.png'>### Objectives</iconp>

I can read a 2-10 block sequence with directional moves.

## Engage: Introduction to Directional Moves (2 min)

- [ ] **Introduce** students to a sequence with directional moves. (1 min)
<iconp type='question'>What stands out in this sequence?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Which line of code is different than the others?</iconp>
- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Students make predictions about the turtle’s location. (1 min)
<iconp type='question'>Where do you think the turtle will end up after following the directions in the sequence?</iconp>
- [ ] **Share Out:** Volunteers share their predictions with the class. (1 min)

## Explore: Stepping with Directional Moves (8 min)

- [ ] **Independent Exploration:** Students attempt to step through the sequence from the Engage activity. (3 min)
	- Pass out a practice worksheet, token and pencil to each student.
	- Have students place the turtle on the number 4 in practice problem number one.
	- Give the class 2 minutes to determine the final location of the turtle using the materials.

- [ ] **Discuss** what the code did as a class. (2 min)

<iconp type='question'>Where did the turtle stop?</iconp>


## Explain: Stepping with Directional Moves (7 min)
- [ ] **Model** using the push, check, move protocol to step through the sequence from the Engage activity. (2 min)
	1. *Push* the line of code.
> > “First I push the line of code that I’m on.”
	1. *Check* the line using your pencil.  
> > “Next I write a check on the line of code I read.”
	1. *Move* the turtle.
> > “Then I move the turtle. I keep repeating these three steps until I finish reading the sequence.”
- [ ] **Guided Practice:** Students step through two sequences by following along with the teacher. (5 min)

## Elaborate: Letter Stepping (10 min)

- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students step through sequences independently using the practice worksheet and token. (8 min)

Worksheet Directions
- The goal is to determine the letter or number the turtle stops on after stepping through each sequence.
- The turtle starts on the star for each sequence.
- Students must write the letter or number in the blank box above the sequence.

![elaborate](./images/elaborate.png)

- [ ] **Review** problem 3 using the stepping protocol. (2 min)
	1. *Push* the line of code.
	2. *Check* the line using your pencil.  
	3. *Move* the turtle.

- [ ] **Extension:** Students identify sequences with matching objectives. (if time allows)

## Evaluate: Exit Ticket (5 min)
- [ ] **Assess** for mastery by having students complete the exit ticket. (5 min)

Exit Ticket Directions
- The goal is to determine the letter or number the turtle stops on after stepping through each sequence.
- The turtle starts on the star for each sequence.
- Students must write the letter or number in the blank box above the sequence.
