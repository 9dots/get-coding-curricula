## 1. Engage: Writing Review (3 min)
- [ ] **Show** the class a sequence of pixelBot code and click run to show what it does.

<iconp type='question'>What can we do to make this code shorter?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Remind students of the steps that were followed to rewrite code using loops.</iconp>

- _*Find*_ the core of a pattern and the number of times it repeats.
- _*Repeat*_ the core of the pattern.

- [ ] **Review** finding the core of the pattern and the number of times it repeats with the help of students.

<iconp type='question'>Is there a pattern in the sequence of code?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Yes.</iconp>


<iconp type='question'>What is the core of the pattern?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>The core of the pattern is left, up.</iconp>

<iconp type='question'>How many times does the core of the pattern repeat?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>The core of the pattern repeats 3 times.</iconp>


- [ ] **Review** how to repeat the core of the pattern on the pixelBots platform with the help of students.

<iconp type='question'>What is the first thing we should do to repeat the core?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Check the blocks in the core.</iconp>


<iconp type='question'>What is the second thing we should do?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We should click the repeat button.</iconp>


<iconp type='question'>What is the last thing we should do?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We should get rid of the code we are not going to use.</iconp>


## 2. Explore: Loops (7 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** the loop game and call on a volunteer to model how to play.

- [ ] **Explain** how the game is played and show the first sequence of code that will be read.
>> “In the loop game I will pretend to be a computer and read a sequence of code. Our volunteer will act out the code I read. The code I read is like the code we wrote last week in class. It repeats a certain number of times.”

- [ ] **Demonstrate** how to play the game with the volunteer and model reading the loop using a paper to cover the code and a dry erase marker to draw tick marks each time you loop through the code.
  - Show one line of code at a time.
  - Read each line out loud in order for the volunteer to act it out.
  - Draw a tick mark at the bottom of the loop.
  - Continue this process until the number of tick marks at the bottom of the loop matches the number of times the code should be repeated.

- [ ] **Show** the next loop and have rest of the class join the game. Each time you loop through the code, ask the class if you should loop through it again.
>> “Let’s all play together now. This time instead of just having one person act out the code I read, everyone will act it out. I’ll also need your help to figure out when I should stop reading the code.”

- [ ] **Play** one round of the game while modeling how to read the code.

- [ ] **Show** the arrow graphic that summarizes how the code was read.

- [ ] **Define** the word loop.
>> “A loop is a sequence of actions that is repeated.”

- [ ] **Show** the GIFs in the slides and explain that they are examples of loops.

- [ ] **Demonstrate** the loop hand gesture and have the class practice.

## 3. Explain: Reading Loops (8 min)
- [ ] **Model** stepping through a loop.
- [ ] **Explain** the process of stepping through a loop while modeling.
  1. Cover the code inside the loop with an index card.
  2. Show one line of code at a time.
  3. Read each line out loud in order for the volunteer to act it out.
  4. Draw a tick mark at the bottom of the loop.
  5. Continue this process until the number of tick marks at the bottom of the loop matches the number of times the code should be repeated.

- [ ] **Guided Practice:** The class works together to step through a loop.

<iconp type='question'>How many times will the sequence of code repeat?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>The sequence will repeat 3 times.</iconp>
  1. Have students cover the code inside the loop with their index cards.
  1. Have students slide the index card to show the first line of code.
  1. Have the class move their token according to the line of code that was read.
  1. Continue steps 2 and 4 until the bottom of the loop is reached.
  1. Have students draw a tick mark at the bottom of the loop.
  1. Have students continue steps 1-5 until they have 3 tick marks at the bottom of the loop.

## 4. Elaborate: Independent Practice (12 min)
- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students complete a series of stepping challenges on the Reading Loops Worksheet.
- [ ] **Monitor** the room for students in need of additional assistance.
- [ ] **Review** 1-2 challenges with the whole class.
- [ ] **Debrief** the lesson.
