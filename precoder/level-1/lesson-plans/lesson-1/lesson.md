## Explore: Mystery Robot (10 min)

<note type='key' title='Key Points'>
- Clues help us solve problems by eliminating possibilities.
- Some clues help us eliminate more possibilities than others.
</note>

**Goal:** Students must determine the identity of the mystery robot by using the clues provided by the teacher.
- [ ] Pass out a robot board and a dry erase marker to each student. 
- [ ] Select a robot from the deck of cards and share a clue.
- [ ] Model how to eliminate robots that do not fit the clue by crossing them out on slide 2. 
- [ ] Have students eliminate robots on their robot boards with a dry erase marker.
- [ ] Continue sharing clues and having students eliminate robots until only one robot is left.

## Evaluate: Discussion (3 min)

<note type='key' title='Key Points'>
- Each guess made and question asked got the group closer to figuring out the mystery robot.
- It is ok not to get something right the first time. 
- We can learn just as much from being wrong as we can from being right.
</note>

Debrief the activity with a discussion.
