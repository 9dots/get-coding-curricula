<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 2 students begin to develop an understanding of how to use commands to control the actions of a computer. Students are introduced to the idea that commands must be clear and precise in order for a computer to carry them out.

## Engage: Warm Up (7 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** the toothbrushing activity.
>> “I need your help. I have forgotten how to brush my teeth. I brought my toothpaste and toothbrush so that you can teach me how.”

<iconp type='question'>What should I do to brush my teeth? Tell me what I should do one step at a time.</iconp>

<note type='key' title='Key Points'>The purpose of this activity is for students to see how important it is to give clear and precise directions when communicating with a computer. Follow all student directions literally to show how directions can lead to undesired outcomes if not they are not clear and precise. For example, if a student says to place toothpaste on the toothbrush, place the tube of toothpaste on the toothbrush.</note>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Students share their directions with the class.

- [ ] **Debrief** the activity.
>> “This year we will learn how to make computers do things like paint objects and move characters. When we give instructions to a computer we have to make sure our directions are clear because a computer can’t figure out what you mean in the same way a person can. When you gave me directions that were not clear I only pretended not to understand to show you how a computer may not understand your directions and do something you don’t want it to do.”

- [ ] **Define** code.
>> “When we give a computer instructions to do something we call that coding. This year you are all going to learn how to write code. The instructions we give to a computer are called code.”

## Explore: Navigation (7 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** the grid navigation activity. Stand on the floor grid and place the paper star in an adjacent square.
>> “In this activity we are going to create instructions that we will use to make our computer do things like move characters on the screen and paint pictures.
I am standing in a square. In the square next to me there is a star. If I wanted to stand in the square with the star and I did not know how to get there, what would you say to give me directions to move to the star?”

<iconp type='question'>What instructions would you give me to get to the star?</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Students share ideas of how they will direct the teacher to the star on the grid.

- [ ] **Introduce** the next challenge in which the class must complete the same task without using their voices.
>> “In this next challenge, I want to stand in the square with the star again. This time you have to give me instructions without using your voice.”

<iconp type='question'>How would you give me instructions without using your voice?</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Students demonstrate how they would give the teacher directions without their voice.

- [ ] **Introduce** the next challenge in which the class must complete the same task without using a set of direction cards.
>> “In the last challenge I want to get to the star again. This time you have to give me instructions by using the cards that I just gave you.”

<iconp type='question'>How would you give me instructions with the card?</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Students demonstrate how they would give the teacher directions using the navigation cards.

- [ ] **Demonstrate** the proper way to use the navigation cards.

## Explain: turtleGo (7 min)
- [ ] **Introduce** the grid navigation activity with game controllers.
>> “Now that we know how to use the arrows we can use our game controllers to to give instructions. In this activity you are going to continue to give me instructions in order to move me to the star. This time you will press the arrow button that you think will move me to the star.”

- [ ] **Demonstrate** how to properly hold the game controller.

- [ ] **Check** students to ensure that they are holding the game controller properly.

- [ ] **Show** the first challenge. Stand on the grid and place the paper star in an adjacent square. Have the class press the button on the controller they would use to direct you to the star.

<iconp type='question'>Which color arrow did you press to move me to the square with the star?</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Students share out the button they would press to give the teacher directions.

- [ ] **Show** the next challenge and have students share their responses in the same manner. Continue this process until students have had to use all 4 arrow directions on the game controller.

- [ ] **Show** the navigation worksheet to the class.

- [ ] **Model** completing the first challenge and have students copy the solution on their worksheet.
>> “To complete this challenge I have to circle the arrow direction that I would use to move the turtle to the star. In this first challenge I need to move my turtle to the right so I will circle the yellow arrow because the yellow arrow points to the right. Circle the yellow arrow on your worksheet to show the correct answer..”

- [ ] **Guided Practice:** Have the class assist in completing the second challenge on the worksheet by having individuals students volunteer to share their answers.
>> “In this next challenge I’m going to need your help.”

<iconp type='question'>Which color arrow should I circle to get my turtle to move to the star?</iconp>


## Elaborate: turtleMove (7 min)
- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students complete the navigation worksheet independently.

- [ ] **Monitor** the class for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Review** 2-3 challenges from the navigation worksheet with the class.

## Evaluate: Debrief (4 min)
- [ ] **Debrief** the lesson with the class.
>> “In this lesson we were able to come up with a set of instructions to communicate with our turtle.”

<iconp type='question'>What did we use to give our turtle directions?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We used arrows to give our turtle directions.</iconp>

<iconp type='question'>Why do you think it was important for us to create simple instructions for our turtle bot to follow?</iconp>
