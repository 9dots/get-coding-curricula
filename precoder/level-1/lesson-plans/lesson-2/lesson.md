<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 2 students begin to develop an understanding of how to use commands to control the actions of a computer. Students are introduced to the idea that commands must be clear and precise in order for a computer to carry them out.

- I can use a set of commands to direct my turtle’s movement.

## 1. Engage: Warm Up (7 min)

- [ ] Have students volunteer to give you directions on how to brush your teeth. Act out each student’s directions as they share.


**Note:** The purpose of this activity is for students to see how important it is to give clear and precise directions. Each direction a student gives should be followed literally to show how directions that are not clear and precise can be misinterpreted.

**Example:** If a student says to put toothpaste on the toothbrush, place the tube of toothpaste on the toothbrush.


<note type='key' title='Key Points'>
- This year we will learn how to make make computers do things like draw objects and navigate characters.
- In order to make computers do tasks for us, we have to learn how to give them instructions.
- Giving instructions to a computer is what we call coding.
</note>

## 2. Explore/Explain: turtleMove (5 min)

- [ ] Place the star on the floor grid and stand in an adjacent square.
- [ ] Tell students that you need help navigating to the colored tile.
- [ ] Have volunteers to give you directions to the colored tile.

- [ ] Present the same scenario. This time inform students that they cannot use their voice.
- [ ] Have volunteers to give you directions to the colored tile.
- [ ] Ask the class:

<iconp type='question'>What was different this time?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>We had to use visuals like signals, gestures, or symbols to communicate our directions.</iconp>

- [ ] Pass out direction cards and ask students how they would use them to give you directions.
- [ ] Move the star to different adjacent squares and have the class practice giving you directions with the directions card.

## 3. Elaborate: Turtle Go (15 min)

Pass out 1 game controller cutout to each student and project the large game controller from the slideshow.
<br/>
- [ ] Demonstrate how to orient and hold the game controller. Make sure each student is holding it properly.
- [ ] Place a star in one square of the grid and stand in another square at the opposite end of the grid.

- [ ] Ask the whole group to press the button they would use to get the turtle closer to the star.
- [ ] Have a volunteer share his/her choice and ask the class to agree or disagree by raising their hands.
- [ ] Once the group agrees on a button have a volunteer press the button on the large controller and move to an adjacent square in response to the button that was selected.
- [ ] Repeat this process until you reach the star.

## 4. Evaluate: Discussion (5 min)

Debrief the activity with a discussion.
