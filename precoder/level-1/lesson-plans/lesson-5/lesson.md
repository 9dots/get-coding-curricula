Lesson 5 introduces students to writing code on the Pixel Bot platform. As an introduction, students are asked to solve a task in which they naturally explore the platform’s user interface on their own. After allowing a brief period of struggle, the teacher answers student questions and gives a formal tutorial on how to write code on the platform.

## Engage: Pixel Bot Predictions (5 min)
- [ ] Show students the code on slide 2 and ask the question below.


<iconp type='question'>What do you think would happen if the character on the screen followed these directions?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>The character would move 5 spaces.</iconp>

<br/>

- [ ] As students make their predictions mark where they think the character would stop with a marker on the board.
- [ ] Run the code and emphasize the connection between each individual coding block and the character’s movement.
- [ ] Tell students that today they will be writing their very own code.

## Explore: Challenge (2 min)
- [ ] Show slide 3. Tell students that they will be given 2 minutes to try to complete the challenge independently. Add that during this time you will not be answering any questions so that they can try on their own.
- [ ] Reassure students that it is ok if they don’t figure it out as long as they try their hardest during the 2 minutes.
- [ ] Have students try to complete the challenge by getting the character to move to marked square and paint it black.

## Explain: Pixel Bot 101 (5 min)
- [ ]Ask the class the questions below.


<iconp type='question'>What was the hardest part of trying to complete the challenge on your own?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Answers will vary.</iconp>

<br/>

<iconp type='question'>What are some things you tried to do to complete the challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Answers will vary.</iconp>

<br/>

<iconp type='question'>What did you learn to do on Pixel Bot while trying to complete the challenge?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Answers will vary.</iconp>

<br/>

- [ ] Demonstrate how to complete the challenge and explain what each of the major sections of the Pixel Bot interface do:
   - [ ] **Editor:** The editor is the space where the code we write is located.
   - [ ] **Palette:** The palette is where we select individual coding blocks by clicking them.
   - [ ] **Stage:** The stage is where we see the character act out the code we wrote in the editor.
   - [ ] **Run Button:** The run button tells the computer act out the code we wrote in the editor.

- [ ] Present the challenge on slide 4 and perform a code along with the class. 
   - [ ] Solve the problem one step a time making sure to stop and allow students to copy what you do on their computers.
   - [ ] As you solve the problem, highlight all of the parts of the Pixel Bot interface that you described in the previous demonstration.

## Elaborate: Independent Practice (15 min)
- [ ] Have students complete the series of independent practice problems on Pixel Bot.
- [ ] Monitor the class for students that are in need of additional assistance.
- [ ] After 10 minutes have passed, review 2-3 problems on the board.
- [ ] If students are comfortable, have 1 or 2 students come to the front and complete one of the challenges for the class on your computer.

## Evaluate: Exit Ticket (3 min) 

- [ ] Have students complete the 2 Pixel Bot exit ticket challenges.
- [ ] Monitor the room to ensure all students are finished.
