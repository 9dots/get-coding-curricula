<iconp src='/icons/activity.png'>### Overview</iconp>
In lesson 17 students learn to identify patterns and the number of times they repeat in the context of pixelBot code. The lesson begins with the class making connections between a pattern in the movements of a pixelBot and a pattern in its corresponding code. Students then learn to identify patterns and the number of times they repeat in a sequence of code.

## Engage: Patterns Review (4 min)
- [ ] **Present** the review problem.

- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Students examine a pattern and attempt to identify the repeating sequence.

<iconp type='question'>What pattern do you see?</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Students share the repeating sequence they identified.
- [ ] **Challenge** the class to identify the number of times the sequence repeats in the pattern.

<iconp type='question'>How many times does the pattern repeat?</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Students share the number of times the sequence repeats.

## Explore: pixelBot Patterns (4 min)
- [ ] **Challenge** the class to identify a pattern in the pixelBot video.

- [ ] **Show** the pixelBot video.

- [ ] **Turn and Talk:** Students discuss the pattern they identified in the video.

<iconp type='question'>What pattern did you see in the video?</iconp>

- [ ] **Share Out:** Students share the pattern they identified in the video.

- [ ] **Show** students the sequence of code that directed the bot’s movement in the video.
- [ ] **Challenge** the class to identify a pattern in the sequence of code.

<iconp type='question'>What pattern do you see in the code?</iconp>

## Explain: Patterns in Code (10 min)
- [ ] **Explain** that the images the bot colored are a representation of patterns in the code.
>> “In pixelBot we can color patterns by coding patterns in the directions we give our bot. In the last video we saw a pattern that our bot painted because someone coded a pattern in its directions. We can think of this as the bot acting out a pattern that someone coded.”

- [ ] **Challenge** the class to identify a pattern in the next video.
>> “In the next video we are going to try to find a pattern in what the bot does. Then we are going to try to find a matching pattern in the code.”

- [ ] **Show** the pixelBot video.

- [ ] **Discuss** the patterns that students saw in the video.

<iconp type='question'>What pattern did you see in the video?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>Was there a pattern in the way the bot moved?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many times did the bot repeat that pattern?</iconp>

- [ ] **Show** the class the the code the bot acted out.

- [ ] **Discuss** the patterns that students see in the code.

<iconp type='question'>What pattern do you see in the code?</iconp>
<iconp type='question'>How many times does the pattern repeat?</iconp>

- [ ] **Model** completing problem number one on the patterns worksheet and have students copy the answer.
>> “The directions in this code are up, left, up, left. It looks like the sequence that repeats is up, left. To show that this is the repeating sequence I am going to box it. Then I will box the next two blocks that continue the pattern. Now that I’ve boxed them all, I will count the number of boxes I made to show the number of times the sequence repeats and write the number at the top.”

- [ ] **Guided Practice:** The class works together to identify the repeating sequence in problem number two.
>> “Let’s say the directions we see in this sequence out loud together. Right, down, right, down, right, down.”

<iconp type='question'>What part of this code keeps repeating?</iconp>

- [ ] **Guided Practice:** The class works together to find the number of times the sequence repeats in the code.
>> “Let’s put a box around the first sequence that shows right and left and then do the same for all of the following right-down sequences.”

<iconp type='question'>How many times does this sequence repeat?</iconp>

## Elaborate: Independent Practice (12 min)
- [ ] **Independent Practice:** Students work on the patterns worksheet independently.

- [ ] **Monitor** the room for students in need of additional assistance.

- [ ] **Review** 2-3 problems from the worksheet.

- [ ] **Debrief** the lesson.

<iconp type='question'>What did we learn to do today?</iconp>
<iconp type='answer'>Today we learned how to find patterns in our code and identify the number of times they repeat.</iconp>
